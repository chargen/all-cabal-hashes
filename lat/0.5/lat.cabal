synopsis           : Tool to track security alerts on LWN
description        : 
    lat (Linux Alert Tracker) is a tool for tracking security alerts published
    on Linux Weekly News (http://lwn.net/Security/).  It does this by scraping
    information from the site and recording it in a local database (sqlite3).

    Alerts are organised by distribution in the same way as on the LWN site.
    They can also be filtered so that only alerts on packages of interest to
    the user are shown.

    It is also possible to directly from the tool raise a bug in a bugtracker
    based on an alert.  (Only Jira is supported yet.)

    The envisioned user is someone who's interested in following the security
    alerts of a specific distribution, e.g. someone who's basing a project on
    a sub-set of packages from a distribution.
