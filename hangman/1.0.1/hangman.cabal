Name:                hangman
Version:             1.0.1

Synopsis:            Hangman implementation in Haskell written in two hours.
Description:
  A command line implementation of the classic hangman game.
  I wrote this when I was desperately bored during exam revision period
  in a couple of hours.
  
  Hopefully you will find the implementation to be of use. It sort of began as
  an assessment of the Haskell development experience, but I plan to continue
  to maintain and extend the implementation to demonstrate how to apply good
  software development practises to Haskell code.
