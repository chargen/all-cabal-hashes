Description:
  Haskell bindings for the Apache Thrift RPC system. Requires the use of the thrift code generator.
  Includes backported Framed Transport implementation, which Cassandra now uses by default[1]. 
  .
  NOTE: this package will be eventually deprecated, replaced by Christian Lavoie's thrift package[2],
  once Framed Transport support that is in Thrift's svn trunk (and backported here) is included there.
