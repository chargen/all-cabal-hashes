Name:              combinatorial-problems
Version:           0.0.3
Synopsis:          A number of data structures to represent and allow the manipulation of standard combinatorial problems, used as test problems in computer science.
Description:       In computer science there are a number of standard test problems that are used for testing algorithms, 
                   especially those related to Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research. Online there are a number 
                   of repositories for collections of known interesting problems, for example the TSPLIB at 
                   <http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/> and the SATLIB at 
                   <http://www.satlib.org/>. 
                   .
                   This library seeks to provide implementations of data structures to store these problems, along with 
                   functions for manipulating the problems and routines to load problem files from various sources. 
                   .
                   At present it only supports TSP\/TSPLIB and SAT\/SATLIB, however it is hoped that the loading routines 
                   can be expanded and the range of problems expanded to cover problems like scheduling and timetabling.
                   The internal data structures make heavy use of the @Data.Map@ library and @Data.Array@. It is not currently
                   using unboxed values. The library does not use the @bytestring@ library for loading and saving data either, 
                   which will probably need to be changed later.
