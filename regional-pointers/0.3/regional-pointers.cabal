synopsis:      Regional memory pointers
description:   The library allows you to allocate memory in a region yielding a
               regional pointer to it. When the region terminates all pointers
               are automatically freed. Most importantly, a pointer can't be
               returned from the region. So it's impossible to reference
               unallocated memory.
               .
               The primary technique used in this package is called \"Lightweight
               monadic regions\" which was invented by Oleg Kiselyov and
               Chung-chieh Shan. See:
               .
               <http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/regions.html#light-weight>
               .
               This technique is implemented in the @regions@ package which is
               re-exported from this library.
               .
               This library provides wrappers around all the @Ptr@ functions
               from the @Foreign.*@ modules from @base@.
