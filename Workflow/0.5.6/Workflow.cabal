name:                Workflow
version:              0.5.6
synopsis:            library for transparent execution  of interruptible  computations
description:
     Transparent support  for interruptable computations. A workflow can be seen as a persistent thread that executes any
     monadic computation. Therefore, it can be used in very time consuming computations such are CPU intensive calculations
     or procedures that are most of the time waiting for the action of a process or an user, that are prone to comunication
     failures, timeouts or shutdowns.
     .
     The computantion can be restarted at the interrupted point because such monad is encapsulated inside
     a state monad transformer that transparently checkpoint the computation state. Besides that, the package also provides
     other services associated to workflows
     The main features are:
     .
     * logging of each intermediate action results in disk.
     .
     * resume  the monadic computation at the last checkpoint after soft or hard interruption.
     .
     * suspend a computation until the input object meet certain conditions. useful for inter-workflow comunications.-
     .
     * Communications with other processes including other workflows trough persistent data objects,
        inspection of intermediate workflow results ,  persistent  queues, persistent timeouts so that no data is lost due
        to shutdowns
      .
      * A workflow can initiate anoter workflow and wait for the resutl
      .
      * workflow management and monitoriing, view workflow history and intermediate results.
