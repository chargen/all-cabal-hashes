name:                algebraic-classes
version:             0.3.2
synopsis:            Conversions between algebraic classes and F-algebras.
description:         Algebraic classes are type classes where all the methods return a value of the same type, which is also the class parameter.
                     Examples from @base@ are @Num@ and @Monoid@.
                     .
                     F-algebras are functions @f a -> a@, where the functor @f@ is called the signature, and the type @a@ the carrier.
                     .
                     This package relates these 2 concepts, and can create conversions between the two using Template Haskell.
                     More specifically, it can generate:
                     .
                     * signatures from algebraic classes
                     .
                     * instances of algebraic classes from F-algebras.
                     .
                     This is useful because type classes are more commonly used in Haskell than F-algebras, but F-algebras are
                     easier to work with, because they are just functions.
