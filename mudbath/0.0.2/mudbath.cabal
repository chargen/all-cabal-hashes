synopsis:            Continuous deployment server for use with GitHub
description:
    Mudbath is continuous deployment server which integrates with GitHub. It
    listens for deployment events and when it receives one, executes a shell
    script. It reports progress back to GitHub in the form of deployment
    status updates.

    Mudbath can also send notifications to Slack if the proper keys are
    provided. Other notification sinks can be easily added if needed.
