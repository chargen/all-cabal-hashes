Synopsis: A collection of explicit Runge-Kutta methods of various orders
Description: This package contains a collection of explicit Runge-Kutta
             methods of various orders, some with fixed-size steps (no
             error estimate) and some intended for adaptive stepsize
             (ie, they include an error estimate). There are a couple of
             test programs which include some adaptive stepsize control,
             however there is not yet any such routine in the library
             itself. There is not yet much in the way of documentation.
             It's version 1.0.2 because the initial version wasn't cabalized.
