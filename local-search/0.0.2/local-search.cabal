Name:              local-search 
Version:           0.0.2
Synopsis:          A first attempt at generalised local search within Haskell, for applications in combinatorial optimisation. 
Description:       This library represents a first attempt at creating a generalised library for
                   local (non-exhaustive) search in Haskell.  It is based on work presented to
                   IFL2010, a draft of which is currently available on the homepage. The library
                   models local search space using a rose tree, with child nodes forming the
                   neighbourhood of any solution. The tree can then be transformed by various
                   combinators to implement different searching strategies; the result is then
                   "navigated" to yield a sequence of solutions.
