Synopsis:            A driver for Redis key-value database
Description:
	Redis (<http://redis.io>) is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced
	key-value store. It is often referred as a data structure server
	since keys can contain different data structures, such as strings,
	hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.
    .
    This library is a Haskell driver for Redis. Note that this library
	supports the most recent (actually the git one) version of
	Redis. Most of the functions will work correctly with stable
	version but not all.
	.
	Changes from v0.9:
	.
	- New commands implemented: echo, linsert, zrevrangebyscore,
      lpushx and rpushx
	.
	- blpop and brpop has changed their types: it's now IO (Maybe (s1,
      s2)) instead of IO (Reply s2). Warning! It's backward
      incompatible!
	.
	- New helpers fromRBulk' and fromRMultiBulk' which not only
      unwraps RBulk and RMulti replies but also (unsafely) unwraps
      /Maybes/ inside it.
	.
	- Now it's posible to use Redis renamed commands (config option
      /rename-command/). You just have to call /renameCommand/ to make
      client configuration the same as the server one.
	.
	- Type of run_multi changed. The second param is now (Redis -> IO
      a) action instead of list of IO (Reply ()). Warning! It's
      backward incompatible!
	.
	- Type of run_cas changed too. The third param is now (Redis -> IO
      a) action instead of IO (Reply ()). Warning! It's backward
      incompatible!
	.
	- Most of the protocol functions is now covered with tests (and
      all tests are passed with the most recent Redis version). You
      may run it using something like \"runhaskell Test.hs
      \<path-to-your-redis-binary\>\". \*Warning!\* Don't do that if you
      have running redis instance on the default port and host! All
      data in databases 0 and 1 will be lost!
	.
