Synopsis:            A driver for Redis key-value database
Description:

	This library is deprecated in favour of the hedis package,
        but minor patches to keep it building etc will be applied.
	.
	.
	Redis (<http://redis.io>) is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced
	key-value store. It is often referred as a data structure server
	since keys can contain different data structures, such as strings,
	hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.
    .
    This library is a Haskell driver for Redis. It's tested with
    current git version and with v2.4.6 of redis server. It also
    tested with v2.2 and basic functions are works correctly
    but not all of them.
	.
	You can use Test module from the source package to run unit
	tests. Try /runhaskell Test.hs --help/ for usage info. Caution! Do not
	run tests on your working database - test database will be
	flushed.
	.
	There are simple benchmark module included: Benchmark.hs. It shows
	me about two times less requests per second than redis-benchmark
	from server distribution.
	.
	Please let me know if tests or benchmark goes terribly wrong.
	.
	Changes from v0.12:
	.
	- nothing here
