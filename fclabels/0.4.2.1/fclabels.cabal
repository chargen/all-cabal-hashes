Synopsis:        First class accessor labels.

Description:     First class labels that act as bidirectional record fields.
                 The labels are fully composable and can be used to get, set
                 and modify parts of a datatype in a consistent way. The label
                 datatype, conveniently called `:->', is an instance of the
                 `Category' type class meaning it has a proper identity and
                 composition. The library has support for automatically
                 deriving labels from record selectors that start with an
                 underscore. Labels can be used in a purely functional setting
                 or be applied to mutable state in some state monad.
                 .
                 To illustrate this package take the following two example
                 datatypes (somehow Haddock removes the braces):
                 .
                 > data Person = Person {
                 >     _name   :: String
                 >   , _age    :: Int
                 >   , _isMale :: Bool
                 >   , _place  :: Place
                 >   }
                 .
                 > data Place = Place {
                 >     _city
                 >   , _country
                 >   , _continent :: String
                 >   }
                 .
                 Both are record datatypes with all record labels prefixed with
                 an underscore.  This underscore is an indication for our
                 Template Haskell code to derive labels for these fields.
                 Deriving labels can be done with this simple one-liner:
                 .
                 > $(mkLabels [''Person, ''Place])
                 .
                 Label function will be generated, label type signatures will
                 not. This is actually not that bad, by writing the signatures
                 down yourself you will be able to give them documentation,
                 something that would be hard otherwise. So, lets give
                 functions a signature by hand:
                 .
                 > name      :: Person :-> String
                 > age       :: Person :-> Int
                 > isMale    :: Person :-> Bool
                 > place     :: Person :-> Place
                 > city      :: Place :-> String
                 > country   :: Place :-> String
                 > continent :: Place :-> String
                 .
                 These type signatures look very similar to the function types
                 for normal record labels, except that the additional colon
                 indicates a true first class label.  These labels can be used
                 to get, set and modify the value and are fully composable.
                 .
                 Now let look at this example. This 71 old fellow, called Jan,
                 is my neighbour and didn't mind using him as an example:
                 .
                 > jan :: Person
                 > jan = Person "Jan" 71 True (Place "Utrecht" "The Netherlands" "Europe")
                 .
                 When we want to be sure Jan is really as old as he claims we
                 can use the @get@ function for labels to get the age out as an
                 integer:
                 .
                 > hisAge :: Int
                 > hisAge = get age jan
                 .
                 Consider he now wants to move to Amsterdam, what better place
                 to spend your old days. Using composition when can change the
                 city value deep inside the structure:
                 .
                 > moveToAmsterdam :: Person -> Person
                 > moveToAmsterdam = set (city . place) "Amsterdam"
                 .
                 > moveToAmsterdam jan ==
                 >  Person "Jan" 71 True (Place "Amsterdam" "The Netherlands" "Europe")
                 .
                 Composition is done using the dot operator which is part of
                 the @Control.Category@ module. Make sure to import this module
                 and hide the default @(.)@, @id@ and @mod@ function from the
                 Prelude.
                 .
                 Now, because Jan is an old guy moving to another city is not a
                 very easy task, this really takes a while. So it will probably
                 take no less than two years before he will actually be
                 settled. To reflect this change it might be useful to have a
                 first class view on the @Person@ data type that only reveals
                 the age and city.  This can be done by using a neat
                 @Applicative@ functor instance:
                 .
                 > ageAndCity :: Person :-> (Int, String)
                 > ageAndCity = Label $ (,) <$> fst `for` age <*> snd `for` (city . place)
                 .
                 Because the applicative type class on its own is not very
                 capable of expressing bidirectional relations, which we need
                 for our labels, the actual instance is defined for an internal
                 helper structure called @Point@. Points are a bit more general
                 than labels. As you can see above the @Label@ constructor has
                 to be used to convert a @Point@ back into a @Label@. The @for@
                 function must be used to indicate which partial destructor to
                 use for which label in the applicative composition.
                 .
                 Now that we have an appropriate age+city view on the @Person@
                 data type (which is itself a label again), we can use the
                 @mod@ function to make Jan move to Amsterdam over exactly two
                 years:
                 .
                 > moveToAmsterdamOverTwoYears :: Person -> Person
                 > moveToAmsterdamOverTwoYears = mod ageAndCity (\(a, b) -> (a+2, "Amsterdam"))
                 .
                 > moveToAmsterdamOverTwoYears jan ==
                 >  Person "Jan" 73 True (Place "Amsterdam" "The Netherlands" "Europe")
                 .
                 This package also contains a lens data type that encodes
                 bidirectional functions. Just like labels lenses can be
                 composed to other lenses using the @Control.Category@ type
                 class. Lenses can be used to change the type of a label. The
                 @Iso@ type class, which can be seen as a bidirectional
                 functor, can be used to apply lenses to labels. For example,
                 when we want to threat the age of a person as a string we can
                 do the following:
                 .
                 > ageAsString :: Person :-> String
                 > ageAsString :: (show <-> read) `iso` age
                 .
                 This library might look cryptic at first sight, but give it a
                 try it is not that hard.
