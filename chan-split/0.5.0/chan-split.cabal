-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Concurrent Chans as read/write pairs. Also provides generic
                     Chan pair class.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         An implementation of concurrent channels identical to 
                     Control.Concurrent.Chan, except that the channel is 
                     represented as a pair, one of which allows only read
                     operations, the other write operations. 
                     .
                     This makes code easier to reason about (the types strictly
                     delegate read/write permission), suggests useful instances
                     (e.g.  'Functor' and 'Contravariant' are easily defined)
                     on the chan pairs, and simplifies the API.
                     .
                     Furthermore this allows messages sent to channels with no
                     readers to be trivially garbage-collected, without relying
                     on inlining optimizations.
                     .
                     We also provide a module that defines a class 'SplitChan'
                     which defines the basic methods any pair of Chan types
                     should provide, allowing easy swapping of Chan
                     implementations.
                     .
                     To use standard Chans with these polymorphic functions,
                     import as follows:
                     .
                     > import Control.Concurrent.Chan hiding (readChan,writeChan,writeList2Chan)
                     > import Control.Concurrent.Chan.Class
                     .
                     When used alongside standard Chans, the Split module can be
                     imported qualified like:
                     .
                     > import qualified Control.Concurrent.Chan.Split as S
                     .
                     Its interface is mostly backwards compatible with Chan.
                     Note, we do not implement the deprecated unGetChan and
                     isEmptyChan functions.
                     .
                     This module is used internally by the "simple-actors" package.
