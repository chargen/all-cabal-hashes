Name:                monadfibre
Version:             0.1
Description:         This package defines a Monad Transformer called @Fibre@,
                     which provides the underlying monad with Choice and Parallelism.
                     Also included is a Class called @MonadBi@ which acts as a superset
                     of @MonadTrans@, and provides @raise@ analogous to @lift@ as well
                     as @lower@, which goes the other way.
                     Natural instances are provided for many Monad Transformers.

Synopsis:            Monad Transformer to provide Choice and Parallelism.
