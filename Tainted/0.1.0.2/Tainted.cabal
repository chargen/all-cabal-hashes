description:    
    A Tainted type contains either a clean or dirty value. Values which are
    clean stay clean as long as an operation performed on them results
    in a clean value. If combined with a dirty value, the value becomes
    tainted as dirty and remains that way through further operations.
   
    This package contains implementations of the Tainted Monad as well as
    TaintedT (the Tainted Monad Transformer), as well as examples of using
    each of them.
