Name:                reactive
Version:             0.0
Synopsis: 	     Simple foundation for functional reactive programming
Category:            reactivity, FRP
Description:
  /Reactive/ is a simple foundation for programming reactive systems
  functionally.  Like Fran\/FRP, it has a notions of (reactive) behaviors and
  events.  Like DataDriven, Reactive has a data-driven implementation.
  The main difference between Reactive and DataDriven is that Reactive
  builds on functional \"futures\" (using threading), while DataDriven
  builds on continuation-based computations.
  .
  Warning: executables using this library must be built with
  @-threaded@.  Otherwise, reactions will be delayed significantly.
  .
  Please see the project wiki page: <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/reactive>
  .
  The module documentation pages have links to colorized source code and
  to wiki pages where you can read and contribute user comments.  Enjoy!
