Name:                reactive
Version:             0.11.2
Synopsis:            Push-pull functional reactive programming
Category:            reactivity, FRP
Description:
  /Reactive/ is a simple foundation for programming reactive systems
  functionally.  Like Fran\/FRP, it has a notions of (reactive) behaviors and
  events.  Unlike most previous FRP implementations, Reactive has a hybrid
  demand/data-driven implementation, as described in the paper \"Push-pull
  functional reactive programming\", <http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/>.
  .
  This version of Reactive has some serious bugs that show up particularly
  with some uses of the Event monad.  Some problems have been due to bugs
  in the GHC run-time support for concurrency.  I do not know whether the
  remaining problems in Reactive are still more subtle RTS issues, or
  some subtle laziness bugs in Reactive.  Help probing the remaining
  difficulties is most welcome.
  .
  Import "FRP.Reactive" for FRP client apps.  To make a Reactive adapter for an
  imperative library, import "FRP.Reactive.LegacyAdapters".
