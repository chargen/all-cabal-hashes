synopsis:            Backend for text editors to provide better Haskell editing support.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         This project contains a library that utilizes the GHC API
                     to provide some special features for Haskell text editors.
                     Libhbb has been designed to extend ghc-mod (which does
                     similar tasks) with certain features. However libhbb is
                     completely independent of ghc-mod. The connection to
                     ghc-mod is established in a package called hbb. The
                     features of libhbb can be used standalone by the means of
                     the executable hbb-simple-cli which is sipped as well.

                     The big outstanding feature that libhbb provides is the
                     ability to inline functions (their body is converted to a
                     lambda function and written in place of the according
                     name).
