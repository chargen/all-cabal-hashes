synopsis:        A multi-paradigm simulation library
description:
    Aivika is a multi-paradigm simulation library which has 
    the following features:
    .
    * allows defining recursive stochastic differential equations of 
      System Dynamics (unordered as in maths via the recursive do-notation);
    .
    * has a basic support of the event-driven paradigm of 
      the Discrete Event Simulation (DES);
    .
    * has a basic support of the process-oriented paradigm of DES
      with an ability to resume, suspend and cancel 
      the discontinuous processes;
    .
    * allows working with limited resources;
    .
    * supports the activity-oriented paradigm of DES;
    .
    * supports the basic constructs for the agent-based modeling;
    .
    * allows creating combined discrete-continuous models;
    .
    * the arrays of simulation variables are inherently supported 
      (this is mostly a feature of Haskell itself);
    .
    * supports the Monte-Carlo simulation;
    .
    * the simulation model can depend on external parameters;
    .
    * uses extensively the signals to notify the model about changing 
      the reference and variable values;
    .
    * allows gathering statistics in time points;
    .
    * hides the technical details in high-level simulation monads
      (two of them support the recursive do-notation).
    .
    Aivika itself is a light-weight engine with minimal dependencies. 
    However, it has additional packages Aivika Experiment [1] and 
    Aivika Experiment Chart [2] that offer the following features:
    .
    * automating the simulation experiments;
    .
    * saving the results in CSV files;
    .
    * plotting the deviation chart by rule 3-sigma, histogram, 
      time series, XY chart;
    .
    * collecting the summary of statistical data;
    .
    * parallel execution of the Monte-Carlo simulation;
    .
    * have an extensible architecture.
    .
    All three libraries were tested on Linux, Windows and OS X.
    .

    Aivika Simulation Library [3] for more details.
