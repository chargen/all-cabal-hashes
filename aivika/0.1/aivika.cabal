synopsis:        A multi-paradigm simulation library
description:
    Aivika is a multi-paradigm simulation library. It allows us to integrate 
    a system of ordinary differential equations. Also it can be applied to
    the Discrete Event Simulation. It supports the event-oriented, 
    process-oriented and activity-oriented paradigms. Aivika also supports 
    the Agent-based Modeling. Finally, it can be applied to System Dynamics.
    .
    The library widely uses monads. The dynamic system is represented as 
    a computation in the Dynamics monad. There is also the DynamicsProc
    monad to represent the discontinuous processes which can be suspended
    at any time and then resumed later. Everything else is expressed through 
    these two monads, including the events, agent handlers and even integrals.
