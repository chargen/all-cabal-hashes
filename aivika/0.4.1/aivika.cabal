version:         0.4.1
synopsis:        A multi-paradigm simulation library
description:
    Aivika is a small simulation library that covers many paradigms. 
    It allows integrating a system of ordinary differential equations. 
    Also it can be applied to the Discrete Event Simulation. It supports 
    the event-oriented, process-oriented and activity-oriented paradigms. 
    Aivika also supports the Agent-based Modeling. Finally, it can be applied 
    to System Dynamics. 
    .
    It is possible due to using a very general approach when the basic 
    modeling entity is just a function of simulation time. The paradigms
    are mainly distinguished by sets of the functions that are used to 
    model the activities. These sets are small and do not pretend
    to be comprehensive. Aivika is mostly a proof-of-concept project
    rather than a big library that knows everything.
    .
    The library widely uses monads. The dynamic system is represented as 
    a computation in the Dynamics monad. There is also the Process
    monad to represent the discontinuous processes which can suspend
    at any time and then resume later. There is also the Simulation monad
    that represents a simulation run, in which scope the previous 
    two monads exist. Almost everything is expressed through these monads, 
    including the event handlers, agent handlers and even integrals 
    except for the parameters and statistics that already use the IO monad.
    .
    The PDF documentation is available at 
    <https://github.com/dsorokin/aivika/blob/master/doc/aivika.pdf>.
    Please note that the documentation is outdated and it corresponds to 
    version 0.2 but it can still be helpful.
