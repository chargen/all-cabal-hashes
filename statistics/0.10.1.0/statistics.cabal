synopsis:       A library of statistical types, data, and functions
description:
  This library provides a number of common functions and types useful
  in statistics.  We focus on high performance, numerical robustness,
  and use of good algorithms.  Where possible, we provide
  references to the statistical literature.
  .
  The library's facilities can be divided into four broad categories:
  .
  * Working with widely used discrete and continuous probability
    distributions.  (There are dozens of exotic distributions in use;
    we focus on the most common.)
  .
  * Computing with sample data: quantile estimation, kernel density
    estimation, histograms, bootstrap methods, significance testing,
    and autocorrelation analysis.
  .
  * Random variate generation under several different distributions.
  .
  * Common statistical tests for significant differences between
    samples.
  .
  Changes in 0.10.1.0
  .
  * Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric test added.
  .
  * Pearson's chi squared test added.
  .
  * Type class for generating random variates for given distribution
    is added.
  .
  * Modules 'Statistics.Math' and 'Statistics.Constants' are moved to
    the @math-functions@ package. They are still available but marked
    as deprecated.
  .
  Changed in 0.10.0.1
  .
  * @dct@ and @idct@ now have type @Vector Double -> Vector Double@
  .
  Changes in 0.10.0.0:
  .
  * The type classes @Mean@ and @Variance@ are split in two. This is
    required for distributions which do not have finite variance or
    mean.
  .
  * The @S.Sample.KernelDensity@ module has been renamed, and
    completely rewritten to be much more robust.  The older module
    oversmoothed multi-modal data.  (The older module is still
    available under the name @S.Sample.KernelDensity.Simple@).
  .
  * Histogram computation is added, in @S.Sample.Histogram@.
  .
  * Forward and inverse discrete Fourier and cosine transforms are
    added, in @S.Transform@.
  .
  * Root finding is added, in @S.Math.RootFinding@.
  .
  * The @complCumulative@ function is added to the @Distribution@
    class in order to accurately assess probalities P(X>x) which are
    used in one-tailed tests.
  .
  * A @stdDev@ function is added to the @Variance@ class for
    distributions.
  .
  * The constructor @S.Distribution.normalDistr@ now takes standard
    deviation instead of variance as its parameter.
  .
  * A bug in @S.Quantile.weightedAvg@ is fixed. It produced a wrong
    answer if a sample contained only one element.
  .
  * Bugs in quantile estimations for chi-square and gamma distribution
    are fixed.
  .
  * Integer overlow in @mannWhitneyUCriticalValue@ is fixed. It
    produced incorrect critical values for moderately large
    samples. Something around 20 for 32-bit machines and 40 for 64-bit
    ones.
  .
  * A bug in @mannWhitneyUSignificant@ is fixed. If either sample was
    larger than 20, it produced a completely incorrect answer.
  .
  * One- and two-tailed tests in @S.Tests.NonParametric@ are selected
    with sum types instead of @Bool@.
  .
  * Test results returned as enumeration instead of @Bool@.
  .
  * Performance improvements for Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests.
  .
  * Module @S.Tests.NonParamtric@ is split into @S.Tests.MannWhitneyU@
    and @S.Tests.WilcoxonT@
  .
  * @sortBy@ is added to @S.Function@.
  .
  * Mean and variance for gamma distribution are fixed.
  .
  * Much faster cumulative probablity functions for Poisson and
    hypergeometric distributions.
  .
  * Better density functions for gamma and Poisson distributions.
  .
  * Student-T, Fisher-Snedecor F-distributions and Cauchy-Lorentz
    distrbution are added.
  .
  * The function @S.Function.create@ is removed. Use @generateM@ from
    the @vector@ package instead.
  .
  * Function to perform approximate comparion of doubles is added to
    @S.Function.Comparison@
  .
  * Regularized incomplete beta function and its inverse are added to
    @S.Function@.
