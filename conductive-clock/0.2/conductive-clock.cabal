-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            a library for displaying musical time in a terminal-based clock

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL THIS AT THIS TIME. This library was for displaying a Conductive TempoClock in a separate terminal. Hackage says it does not build, and I have not been using it. This package is now empty, perhaps to return at a later date. It probably should have remained an experimental package on my website rather than appearing here in Hackage.
