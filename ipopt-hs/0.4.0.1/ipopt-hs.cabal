name:                ipopt-hs
version:             0.4.0.1
synopsis:            haskell binding to ipopt and nlopt including automatic differentiation
description:  a haskell binding to the nonlinear programming solver
              <http://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt Ipopt>. Bindings to
              <http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt NLopt> are
              also included.
             .
              [@installation@]
              needs the c library ipopt installed. Also by default a binding to
              nlopt is included. Nlopt by default does not include shared libraries,
              which seems to be needed to run things from ghci (ie. you need to
              @./configure --enable-shared@ when buildin nlopt).
            .
              A embedded language, similar to the one provided by glpk-hs, is
              defined in "Ipopt.NLP". The goal is to define problems at a level
              similar to other "algebraic modeling languages", but retain some
              of the safety and flexibility available in haskell. There is some
              overhead <http://code.haskell.org/~aavogt/ipopt-hs/examples/bench.html>
              but at least on the small 4-variable constrained optimization
              problem.
             .
              Current limitations include:
             .
              * copying in every iteration happens between between
                "Data.Vector.Storable" and "Data.Vector" might be avoidable
                somehow.  Currently it is done because AD needs a Traversable
                structure, but Storable vectors are not traversable.
             .
              * sparseness of derivatives isn't used
             .
              * no binding to SetIntermediateCallback
