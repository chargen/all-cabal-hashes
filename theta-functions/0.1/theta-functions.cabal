-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Theta-functions implemented as trigonometric series

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:
  Small and simple library for computing values of Theta functions.
  They're the special functions of two variables. Described very well at "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_function".
  Library exports four theta-functions and a small helper to calculate their second parameter.
  Theta functions are functions of Complex variables, FYI.
