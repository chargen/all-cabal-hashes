Name:                reactive-banana
Version:             0.4.1.1
Synopsis:            Small but solid library for
                     functional reactive programming (FRP).
Description:         
    A small but solid library for functional reactive programming (FRP).
    .
    The current focus of this library is to implement
    a subset of the semantic model for functional reactive programming
    pioneered by Conal Elliott.
    .
    Moreover, this library can hooked into /any/
    existing event-based framework.
    It is especially useful in conjunction with existing
    GUI frameworks like @wxHaskell@ or @gtk2hs@.
    .
    This also means that your code can be a mix of FRP and imperative parts.
    Bored of programming imperative GUIs? Write some parts with FRP!
    Don't know how to express something with FRP?
    Switch back to imperative style!
    .
    In the spectrum of possible FRP implementations,
    this one features simple semantics but modest expressivity.
    Predicting space & time usage should be easy.
    .
    Stability forecast:
    Known inefficiencies that will be addressed.
    No semantic bugs expected.
    Significant API changes are likely in future versions.
