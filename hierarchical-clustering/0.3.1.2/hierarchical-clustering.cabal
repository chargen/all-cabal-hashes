Description:
  This package provides a function to create a dendrogram from a
  list of items and a distance function between them.  Initially
  a singleton cluster is created for each item, and then new,
  bigger clusters are created by merging the two clusters with
  least distance between them.  The distance between two clusters
  is calculated according to the linkage type.  The dendrogram
  represents not only the clusters but also the order on which
  they were created.
  .
  This function uses a naÃ¯ve algorithm that represents distances
  in a rectangular distance matrix.  There could be space
  improvements (e.g. using a triangular matrix structure) and
  time improvements (e.g. using a finger tree to avoid traversing
  the whole matrix on every iteration just to see what the
  minimum is).
  .
  Changes in version 0.3.1.2 (version 0.3.1.1 was skipped):
  .
  * Added tests for many things.  Use @cabal test@ =).
  .
  Changes in version 0.3.1:
  .
  * Works with containers 0.4 (thanks, Doug Beardsley).
  .
  * Removed some internal unnecessary overheads and added some strictness.
  .
  Changes in version 0.3.0.1:
  .
  * Listed changes of unreleased version 0.2.
  .
  Changes in version 0.3:
  .
  * Added function @cutAt@.
  .
  * Fixed complexity in Haddock comments.
  .
  Changes in version 0.2:
  .
  * Added function @elements@.
  .
  * Added separate functions for each linkage type.  This may be
    useful if you want to create a dendrogram and your distance
    data type isn't an instance of @Floating@.
