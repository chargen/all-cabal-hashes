Name: quantum-arrow
Description:
    This module is a loose port of the Quantum::Entanglement
    Perl module, which endows its host language with quantum-computationesque
    effects.  In this Haskell version this is done using an
    arrow to take advantage of the arrow syntax for imperative-looking
    code.  The module has all the fun bells and whistles of quantum
    computation, including entanglement and interference, even through
    conditionals (which the Perl analog does not support).  The arrow
    is defined over any instance of MonadRandom, so if you want to
    get especially crazy, you can experiment with what quantum computation
    is like when observables include invoking continuations.

    See the included example.hs for some simple examples of what 
    using this module looks like.
