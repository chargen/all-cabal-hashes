synopsis:               Abstraction for things that work like IORef.
description:            A collection of type-classes generalizing the
                        read\/write\/modify operations for stateful variables
                        provided by things like IORef, TVar, &c.  
                        
                        Note that The interface has changed a bit from the
                        0.2.* version.  \"*Ref\" functions are now called 
                        \"*Reference\" and new \"*Ref\" function exist with 
                        simpler signatures.
                        
                        The new 'Ref' existential type provides a convenient
                        monad-indexed reference type, and the HasRef class
                        indicates monads for which there is a default
                        reference type for every referent.

tested-with:            GHC

Flag useSTM
  Description:          Include instances for STM types
  Default:              True

Flag useTMVar
  Description:          Include instances for TMVar (TMVar is not available
                        in hugs' STM implementation).  I have been unable to
                        make this flag's value depend on whether or not
                        you're running hugs, so if you are, you'll just have
                        to change it manually.  It'd sure be nice if there
                        were either an explicit backtrack command in cabal
                        or if 'buildable:false' would trigger a backtrack.
                        
                        Or if I could say "default: not(impl(hugs))" for this
                        flag.
                        
                        Note that this is irrelevant at the moment because
                        I broke Hugs+STM support by adding MonadIO m => ...
                        instances.  If anyone really wants me to fix it,
                        speak up - but those instances are pretty darn
                        convenient.
                        
  Default:              True
