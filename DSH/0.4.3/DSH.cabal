Name:                DSH
Version:             0.4.3
Synopsis:            Database Supported Haskell
Description:
  This is a Haskell library for database-supported program execution. Using
  this library a relational database management system (RDBMS) can be used as
  a coprocessor for the Haskell programming language, especially for those
  program fragments that carry out data-intensive and data-parallel
  computation.
  .
  Database executable program fragments can be written using the list
  comprehension notation (with modest syntax changes due to quasiquoting) and
  list processing combinators from the Haskell list prelude. Note that rather
  than embedding a relational language into Haskell, we turn idiomatic Haskell
  programs into SQL queries.
  .
  DSH faithfully represents list order and nesting, and compiles the list
  processing combinators into relational queries. The implementation avoids
  unnecessary data transfer and context switching between the database
  coprocessor and the Haskell runtime by ensuring that the number of generated
  relational queries is only determined by the program fragment's type and not
  by the database size.
  .
  DSH can be used to allow existing Haskell programs to operate on large scale
  data (e.g., larger than the available heap) or query existing database
  resident data with Haskell.
  .
  Note that this package is flagged experimental and therefore not suited for
  production use. This is a proof of concept implementation only. To learn
  more about DSH, our paper entitled as "Haskell boards the Ferry:
  Database-supported program execution for Haskell" [1] is a recommended
  reading. The package includes a couple of examples that demonstrate how to
  use DSH.
