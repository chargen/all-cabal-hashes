-- The name of the package.
Name:                extensible-data

-- The package version. See the Haskell package versioning policy
-- (http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Package_versioning_policy) for
-- standards guiding when and how versions should be incremented.
Version:             0.1

-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Sums/products/lists/trees which can be extended in other modules

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:
  Extensible lists: Add to a list at compile-time in many modules, which
  do not necessarily know each other, and then collect it into a single
  list in a module depending on all of them (possibly indirectly).
  .
  Extensible products: It is a record in which new fields can be added
  anywhere including in different modules; dependent defaults are
  supported, so it is still possible to make a value of such a type.
  .
  Extensible sums: Type with choices; new choices can be added anywhere
  including in other modules (which do not need to know each other). The
  operations on them are also freely extensible in the similar way.
  .
  Extensible trees: You can make a tree out of types, and have a value at
  each node. New nodes can be added anywhere if you have access to the
  node which will become the new node's parent.
