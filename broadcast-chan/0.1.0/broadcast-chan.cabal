Synopsis:            Broadcast channel type that avoids 0 reader space leaks.

Description:
    A variation of "Control.Concurrent.Chan" from base, which allows to the
    easy creation of broadcast channels without the space-leaks that may arise
    from using 'Control.Concurrent.Chan.dupChan'.

    The 'Control.Concurrent.Chan.Chan' type from "Control.Concurrent.Chan"
    consists of both a read and write end. This presents a problem when one
    wants to have a broadcast channel that, at times, has zero listeners. To
    write to a 'Control.Concurrent.Chan.Chan' there must always be a read end
    and this read end will hold ALL messages alive until read.

    The simple solution applied in this module is to separate read and write
    ends. As a result, any messages written to the write end can be immediately
    garbage collected if there are no active read ends, avoding space leaks.
