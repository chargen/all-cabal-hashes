description:
    Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the
    applications you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and
    track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. Amazon
    CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon
    DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, as well as custom metrics
    generated by your applications and services, and any log files your
    applications generate. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to gain system-wide
    visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and
    operational health. You can use these insights to react and keep your
    application running smoothly.
