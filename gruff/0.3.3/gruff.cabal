Name:                gruff
Version:             0.3.3
Synopsis:            fractal explorer GUI using the ruff library
Description:
    Mandelbrot Set fractal explorer using the ruff library.
    .
    Requires GTK, OpenGL, and GLSL fragment shader support; lots of RAM
    and multiple CPU cores recommended.
    .
    If you want to explore very deep zooms, you'll need hmpfr which
    currently requires GHC to be compiled with integer-simple instead of
    the default integer-gmp.  To install with MPFR support, use
    @cabal install gruff -fmpfr@.
    Note that the default setting for this flag has changed since gruff-0.2.
    .
    gruff-0.3.3 relaxes dependencies for ghc-7.6.
    .
    gruff-0.3.1 is a bugfix release, fixing a performance problem wherein
    offscreen tiles were needlessly calculated.  The performance gain
    is much less (and in many cases is in fact a performance loss) when
    using integer-simple.
    .
    gruff-0.3 includes a small library to allow external programs to
    create diagrams and animations with gruff.  See the gruff-examples
    package.  The interface has been remodelled to simplify it and add
    informative feature overlays.
    .
    gruff-0.2.1 was a bugfix release.  Changes since gruff-0.2:
    .
      * Supersampling bugs are fixed (no more undocumented quantization
        leading to inconsistent appearance at different zoom levels).
    .
      * Race condition bugs in cache management are fixed (no more
        incompletely rendered images).
    .
      * Internal changes/refactoring to make future additions easier.
    .
    Features in this version include:
    .
      * Interactive fractal browser display with mouse controls:
        .
          * Left click to zoom in (press shift for bigger jumps).
        .
          * Right click to zoom out (press shift for bigger jumps).
        .
          * Middle click to center.
        .
          * Shift middle click to auto-focus.
        .
          * Control left click to label with period.
        .
          * Control right click to label with angled internal address (slow!).
    .
      * Session persistance (stored in @~\/.gruff\/state.gruff@ - states can
        also be loaded from and saved to other files, including labels and
        rays).  Note that the file format is incompatible with previous
        releases of gruff.
    .
      * Tile cache (by default in @~\/.gruff\/cache@ - symlink it somewhere
        with a few GB of space if you plan on exploring a lot).
    .
      * Can use MPFR if desired for higher precision, allowing deeper
        zooms and locating high period nucleii.
    .
      * Limited amount of customizable colouring (colours for interior,
        border, and exterior points, as well as labels and rays).
    .
      * Supersampling for more detailed images (useful range is 1 to 16).
    .
      * Rudimentary scripting support (see the gruff-examples package).
    .
    Future versions will focus on enhancing the scripting support.
