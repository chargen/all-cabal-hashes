synopsis:
  FFI domain specific language, on top of hsc2hs.
description: 
  This is a set of macros to be used when writing Haskell FFI.
  They were designed to be able to fully describe C interfaces,
  so that hsc2hs can extract from them all Haskell code needed to
  mimic such interfaces. All Haskell names used are automatically
  derived from C names, structures are mapped to Haskell instances
  of Storable, and there are also macros you can use with C code
  to help write bindings to inline functions or macro functions.
  Documentation is available at package homepage:
  .
  <http://bitbucket.org/mauricio/bindings-dsl>
  .
  This package contains no Haskell code, only C header files
  designed for hsc2hs.
