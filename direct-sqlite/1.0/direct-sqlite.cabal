synopsis: Low-level binding to SQLite3.  Includes UTF8 and BLOB support.
description:
  This package is not very different from the other SQLite3 bindings out there, but
  it fixes a few deficiencies I was finding.  It is not as complete as bindings-sqlite3,
  but is slightly higher-level, in that it supports marshalling of data values to and
  from the database.  In particular, it supports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs
  represented as ByteStrings.
