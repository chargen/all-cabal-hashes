category: Database
synopsis: Low-level binding to SQLite3.  Includes UTF8 and BLOB support.
Cabal-version: >= 1.10
Build-type: Simple
description:
  This package is not very different from the other SQLite3 bindings out
  there, but it fixes a few deficiencies I was finding.  It is not as
  complete as bindings-sqlite3, but is slightly higher-level, in that it
  supports marshalling of data values to and from the database.  In
  particular, it supports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs represented
  as ByteStrings.
  
  Version 2.1 improves handling of invalid UTF-8 and changes error handling
  to be more complete.  It also adds a build flag to build against the system
  sqlite instead of the bundled one, optionally (disabled by default).
  
  Version 2.0 uses Text for strings instead of String.
  
  Version 1.1.0.1 switches to the Faction packaging system and makes no other
  changes.
  
  Version 1.1 adds the SQLite amalgamation file (version 3.7.5) to the project, so that
  there are no external dependencies.
