description:
  This library provides a simple interface to Yices, an SMT solver available
  from <http://yices.csl.sri.com/>.
  .
  It uses the Yices C API, which you will need to have installed.  The API is
  not installed on the Hackage server, so you may need to download this package
  in order to read its documentation.  Sorry.
  .

  The core functionality is provided by modules @Types@ and @Run@, and
  re-exported by @Yices.Easy@.  Module @Sugar@ provides optional syntactic
  sugar, and @Build@ provides optional monadic bookkeeping.
  .
  The library aims for simplicity, and not all features of Yices are supported.
  Suggestions and patches are welcome.
