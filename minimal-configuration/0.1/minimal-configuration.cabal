name:                minimal-configuration
version:             0.1
synopsis:            Minimal ini like configuration library with a few extras
description:         
    The module exported provides the ability to manage a configuration file in
    the users home directory (or the Windows equivalent). Where the configuration
    takes the form of key=value, without sections, that for example an \'.ini\'
    would have.
    .
    The library simplifies serilization/deserialization of the configuration into
    a structure similar in behavior to a 'Map', as well as an interactive way to
    fill in values for simple cases.
    .
    Consider the following example, where a user would run the application for the
    first time, it would ask him for his name; however on a followup run it would
    just print a greeting with his name.
    .
    > import System.Config.File
    >
    > main = withConfiguration ".apprc" $ \conf -> do
    >     let name = getV conf "name"
    >     case name of Just n  -> putStrLn $ "hello " ++ n
    >                  Nothing -> do conf' <- fillInteractively conf [("name", acceptNonBlank)]
    >                                saveConfiguration conf'
