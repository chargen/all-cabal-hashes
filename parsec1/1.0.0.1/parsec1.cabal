synopsis:       Portable monadic parser combinators
description:
    Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
    library.  It is simple, safe, well documented (on the package
    homepage), has extensive libraries and good error messages,
    and is also fast.
    .
    This package is the core haskell98 part of the parsec2
    package, intended to preserve its simplicity and portability.
    .

    Note, that the module names overlap with those of parsec from the Haskell
    Platform, therefore I do not recommend to unconditionally use parsec1 (or
    parsec2 and parsec3) as dependency instead of "parsec < 3", "parsec > 2", or
    just "parsec".  In order to ensure the use of these limited and portable
    parsec1 functions, you may want to hide the official parsec package for
    your own developments.
    .
    This version only differs from the pervious one by a changed description.
