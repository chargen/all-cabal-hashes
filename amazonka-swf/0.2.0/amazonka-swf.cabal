description:
    Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build
    applications that coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon
    SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a
    component of your application. Coordinating tasks across the application
    involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in
    accordance with the logical flow of the application. Amazon SWF gives you
    full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying
    about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining
    their state.

    .
    /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>

    /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under
    heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!
