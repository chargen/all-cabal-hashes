description:
    Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build
    applications that coordinate work across distributed components. In
    Amazon SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed
    by a component of your application. Coordinating tasks across the
    application involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and
    concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application.
    Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and
    coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such
    as tracking their progress and maintaining their state.
    .
    /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    .
    /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under
    heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!
