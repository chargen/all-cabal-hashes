name:                free-functors
version:             0.4.1
synopsis:            Provides free functors that are adjoint to functors that forget class constraints. 
description:         A free functor is a left adjoint to a forgetful functor. It used to be the case
                     that the only category that was easy to work with in Haskell was Hask itself, so
                     there were no interesting forgetful functors.
                     .
                     But the new ConstraintKinds feature of GHC provides an easy way of creating
                     subcategories of Hask. That brings interesting opportunities for free (and cofree) functors.
                     .
                     The examples directory contains an implementation of non-empty lists as free semigroups,
                     and automata as free actions. The standard example of free higher order functors is free monads,
                     and this definition can be found in Data.Functor.HFree.
