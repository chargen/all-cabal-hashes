description:
  The Zipper is a data structure that allows typed navigation on a value.
  It maintains a subterm as a current point of focus. The rest of the value
  is the context. Focus and context are automatically updated when navigating
  up, down, left or right in the value. The term that is in focus can also
  be modified.
  .
  This library offers a generic Zipper for families of datatypes. In particular,
  it is possible to move the focus between subterms of different types, in an
  entirely type-safe way. This library is built on top of the multirec library,
  so all that is required to get a Zipper for a datatype family is to instantiate
  the multirec library for that family.
