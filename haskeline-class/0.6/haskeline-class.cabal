Synopsis:               Class interface for working with Haskeline
Description:            
               Haskeline provides all of its functionality within the scope of a monad transformer.
               This module adds two pieces to this:
               .
               * Introduced here is a type-class which defines the operations
                 supported by the Haskeline monad transformer - MonadHaskeline
               .
               * Also is a newtype wrapper around Haskeline's InputT, called
                 HaskelineT. Sadly, InputT defines ints own instance of the
                 mtl MonadState, which is no good for folks wanting to use
                 InputT in an existing monad transformer stack.
                 .
                 HaskelineT also has an instance of MonadState, but it merely
                 lifts the functions further in the transformer stack.
               .
               Large portions of the Haskeline functionality are re-exported
               here for convinience.
               .
