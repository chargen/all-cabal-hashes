Synopsis:       Monadic graph rewriting of hypergraphs with ports and multiedges
Description:
  This library provides a monadic EDSL to define your own graph rewrite system in Haskell. Once you have specified the signature of your graph and a set of rewrite rules, you can apply these rules on a graph to effect a graph transformation. The aim of this library is to make it as convenient as possible to define such a system and experiment with it and is not designed as a backend for high-performance computation.
