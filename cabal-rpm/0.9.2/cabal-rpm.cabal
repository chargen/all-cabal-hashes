Name:                cabal-rpm
Version:             0.9.2
Synopsis:            RPM packaging tool for Haskell Cabal-based packages
Description:
    This package provides a RPM packaging tool for Haskell Cabal-based packages.
    .
    cblrpm has commands to generate a RPM spec file and srpm for a package.
    It can rpmbuild packages, yum install their dependencies, prep packages,
    and install them. There are commands to list package dependencies and
    missing dependencies. The diff command compares the current spec file
    with a freshly generated one and the update command updates the spec file
    to latest version from Hackage.
