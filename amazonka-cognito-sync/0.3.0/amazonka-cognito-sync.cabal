description:
    Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable
    cross-device syncing of application-related user data. High-level client
    libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use these libraries
    to persist data locally so that it's available even if the device is offline.
    Developer credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile device to access
    the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and
    credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of
    key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.

    .
    /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitosync/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    .
    /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under
    heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!
