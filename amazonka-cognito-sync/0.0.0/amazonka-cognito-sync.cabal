description:
    Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that
    enable cross-device syncing of application-related user data.
    High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You
    can use these libraries to persist data locally so that it's available
    even if the device is offline. Developer credentials don't need to be
    stored on the mobile device to access the service. You can use Amazon
    Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and credentials. User data is
    persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of key-value pairs,
    and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.
    .
    /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitosync/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    .
    /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under
    heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!
