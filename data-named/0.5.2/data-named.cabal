name:               data-named
version:            0.5.2
synopsis:           Data types for named entities
description:
    The library provides data types which can be used to represent
    forest structures with labels stored in internal nodes and
    words kept in leaves.  In particular, those types are well suited
    for representing the layer of named entities (NEs).
    .
    The IOB method is implemented in the Data.Named.IOB module and can
    be used to translate between a forest of entities and a sequence
    of compound IOB labels.  This method can be used together with a
    sequence classifier to indirectly model forest structures.
    .
    The Data.Named.Graph module can be used to represent more general,
    graph structures of entities.  The module provides also a lossy
    conversion from a DAG to a disjoint forest of entities.
