name:                MonadCompose
version:             0.8.0.0
synopsis:            Methods for composing monads.
description:         Methods for composing monads.
  .
  The IO monad transformer solves the problem of combining two IO-performing monads, so that neither one needs to provide a MonadIO interface and both can be transformed separately.
  .
  Most known monads have a distributive law. The Distributive module implements distributivity for monad transformers.
  .
  A monad transformer can transform another monad, but if you have two monads both lacking a transformer, there is little you can do in general. However, you can compose them in a coproduct construction. The PlusMonad module implements a similar plan, but differs from coproducts in that it doesn't compress together contiguous uses of a monad.
