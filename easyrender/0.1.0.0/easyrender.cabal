description:         

  This module provides efficient functions for rendering vector
  graphics to a number of formats, including EPS, PostScript, and
  PDF. It provides an abstraction for multi-page documents, as well
  as a set of graphics primitives for page descriptions. 
  .
  The graphics model is similar to that of the PostScript and PDF
  languages, but we only implement a subset of their functionality.
  Care has been taken that graphics rendering is done efficiently and
  as lazily as possible; documents are rendered \"on the fly\",
  without the need to store the whole document in memory.
  .
  The provided document description model consists of two separate
  layers of abstraction:
  .
  * /drawing/ is concerned with placing marks on a fixed surface, and
  takes place in the 'Draw' monad;
  .
  * /document structure/ is concerned with a sequence of pages, their
  bounding boxes, and other meta-data. It takes place in the
  'Document' monad.
  .
  In principle, the functionality provided by EasyRender is similar to
  a subset of Cairo; however, EasyRender is lightweight and at least
  an order of magnitude faster.
