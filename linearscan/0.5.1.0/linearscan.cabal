description:
  The @linearscan@ library is an implementation -- in Coq, extracted to
  Haskell -- of a register allocation algorithm developed by Christian Wimmer.
  It is described in detail in his Masters thesis, which can be found at
  <http://www.christianwimmer.at/Publications/Wimmer04a/Wimmer04a.pdf>.  A
  Java implementation of this same algorithm, by that author, is used in
  Oracle's Graal project.
  .
  This version of the algorithm was written and verified in Coq, containing
  over 130 proved lemmas, at over 5K LOC.  It was funded as a research project
  by BAE Systems (<http://www.baesystems.com>), to be used in an in-house
  compiler written in Haskell.
  .
  In order for the Coq code to be usable from Haskell, it is first extracted
  from Coq as a Haskell library, during which many of Coq's fundamental types
  are mapped directly onto counterparts in the Haskell Prelude.  Thus, it
  should be within the performance range of an equivalent implementation
  written directly in Haskell.
  .
  Note that not every conceivable property of this library has been proven.
  For some of the lower layers this is true, because the algebraic constraints
  on these components could be exhaustively described in the context of their
  use.  However, higher-level components represent a great variety of use
  cases, and not every one of these cases has been proven correct.  This
  represents an ongoing effort, with the hope that proofs will entirely
  replace the necessity for ad hoc unit testing, and that at some point we can
  know that any allocation produced by this library must either fail, or be
  mathematically sound.
  .
  This library's sole entry point is the 'LinearScan.allocate' function, which
  takes a list of information about basic blocks to an equivalent list, with
  annotations indicating allocation choices.
