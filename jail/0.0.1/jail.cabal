Description:

                  Like all of us know, the IO monad from the System.IO module
                  is a wild beast allowing all forms of insecure computations
                  that can read, or even worse, alter /the real world/. Writing
                  to sockets, deleting files or even launching missiles, its
                  possibilities are endless.  This library provides a special
                  IO module that wraps all file and handle based IO operations
                  from the System.IO module, but provides a possibility to run
                  them in an restricted environment. When running a jailed IO
                  computation a file path can be specified all IO operations
                  will be checked against. Accessing files outside this
                  directory is not allowed and results in a runtime error.
                  Additionally, when running a jailed IO computation a
                  whitelist of file handles can be specified that are
                  accessible as well.
                  .

                  For example, running some code with the permission to access
                  all files within (and only within) my home directory and
                  allowing to access the standard output and standard error can
                  be enforced like this:
                  .

                  > Jail.run (Just "/home/sebas") [stdout, stderr] yourUntrustworthyComputation
                  .

                  Only allowing the code to access the standard input and
                  nothing else can be enforced like this:
                  .

                  > Jail.run Nothing [stdin] yourEvenMoreUntrustworthyComputation
                  .

                  Because the jailed IO environment keeps track of all file
                  handles and checks that are opened by its own operations,
                  smuggling in evil file handles from the fierce and dangerous
                  outside world will be punished by border patrol. Only handles
                  from the whitelist or handles securely opened by functions
                  like `openFile' will be accepted. Because of the opaque IO
                  constructor and the restricted set of exported operations
                  this module is not easily fooled.
                  .

                  I would almost dare to say this module is conceptually safe
                  and code with the jailed IO type can blindly be trusted.
                  Except, yes unfortunately except, @unsafePerformIO@ ruins it
                  all. I would almost suggest adding a flag to the compiler to
                  enforce the absence of @unsafeRuinMyTypeSafety@-alike
                  functions in order to be able to create systems in which code
                  can be trusted by its type alone.
                  .
                  Nonetheless, this module is one step forward in trusting your
                  own programs. Some real <http://tinyurl.com/paranoidpeople>
                  prefer writing there software in one of the most insecure
                  programming languages and perform security audits by hand,
                  I'd rather have my compiler do the job. (Anyone who wants to
                  audit this library is more than welcome!)
