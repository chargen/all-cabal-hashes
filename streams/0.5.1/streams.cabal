description:   
  Various Haskell 2010 stream comonads.
  .
  * "Data.Stream.Branching" provides an \"f-Branching Stream\" comonad, aka the cofree comonad, or generalized rose tree. 
  .
  > data Stream f a = a :< f (Stream a)
  .
  * "Data.Stream.Future" provides a coinductive anti-causal stream, or non-empty 'ZipList'. The comonad provides access to only the 
    tail of the stream. Like a conventional 'ZipList', this is /not/ a monad.
  .
  > data Future a = Last a | a :< Future a
  .
  * "Data.Stream.Future.Skew" provides a non-empty skew-binary random-access-list with the semantics of @Data.Stream.Future@. As with
    "Data.Stream.Future" this stream is not a 'Monad', since the 'Applicative' instance zips streams of potentially differing lengths. 
    The random-access-list structure provides a number of operations logarithmic access time, but makes 'Data.Stream.Future.Skew.cons' 
    less productive. Where applicable "Data.Stream.Infinite.Skew" may be more efficient, due to a lazier and more efficient 'Applicative' 
    instance.
  . 
  >
  .
  * "Data.Stream.NonEmpty" provides a non-empty list comonad where the Applicative and Monad work like those of the @[a]@. 
    Being non-empty, it trades in the 'Alternative' and 'Monoid' instances of @[a]@ for weaker append-based 'FunctorAlt' and 'Semigroup'
    instances while becoming a member of 'Comonad' and 'ComonadApply'. Acting like a list, the semantics of '<*>' and
    '<.>' take a cross-product of membership from both 'NonEmpty' lists rather than zipping like a 'Future'
  .
  > data NonEmpty a = a :| [a]
  .
  * "Data.Stream.Infinite" provides a coinductive infinite anti-causal stream. The 'Comonad' provides access to the tail of the
    stream and the 'Applicative' zips streams together. Unlike 'Future', infinite stream form a 'Monad'. The monad diagonalizes 
    the 'Stream', which is consistent with the behavior of the 'Applicative', and the view of a 'Stream' as a isomorphic to the reader 
    monad from the natural numbers. Being infinite in length, there is no 'Alternative' instance, but instead the 'FunctorAlt'
    instance provides access to the 'Semigroup' of interleaving streams.
  .
  > data Stream a = a :< Stream a
  .
  * "Data.Stream.Infinite.Skew" provides an infinite skew-binary random-access-list with the semantics of "Data.Stream.Infinite"
    Since every stream is infinite, the 'Applicative' instance can be considerably less strict than the corresponding instance for 
    "Data.Stream.Future.Skew" and performs asymptotically better.
  .
  >
  .
  * "Data.Stream.Infinite.Functional.Zipper" provides a bi-infinite sequence, represented as a pure function with an accumulating
    parameter added to optimize moving the current focus.
  .
  > data Zipper a = !Integer :~ (Integer -> a)
  .
  * "Data.Stream.Supply" provides a comonadic supply of unique values, which are
    generated impurely as the tree is explored.
  .
  /Changes since 0.5/:
  * Data.Stream.Supply added

  /Changes since 0.1/: 
  .
  * A number of strictness issues with 'NonEmpty' were fixed
  .
  * More documentation
