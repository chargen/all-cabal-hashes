description:
  Various Haskell 2010 stream comonads.
  * "Data.Stream.Future" provides a coinductive anti-causal stream, or non-empty 'ZipList'. The comonad provides access to only the
    tail of the stream. Like a conventional 'ZipList', this is /not/ a monad.
  .
  > data Future a = Last a | a :< Future a
  .
  * "Data.Stream.Future.Skew" provides a non-empty skew-binary random-access-list with the semantics of @Data.Stream.Future@. As with
    "Data.Stream.Future" this stream is not a 'Monad', since the 'Applicative' instance zips streams of potentially differing lengths.
    The random-access-list structure provides a number of operations logarithmic access time, but makes 'Data.Stream.Future.Skew.cons'
    less productive. Where applicable "Data.Stream.Infinite.Skew" may be more efficient, due to a lazier and more efficient 'Applicative'
    instance.
  .
  >
  .
  * "Data.Stream.Infinite" provides a coinductive infinite anti-causal stream. The 'Comonad' provides access to the tail of the
    stream and the 'Applicative' zips streams together. Unlike 'Future', infinite stream form a 'Monad'. The monad diagonalizes
    the 'Stream', which is consistent with the behavior of the 'Applicative', and the view of a 'Stream' as a isomorphic to the reader
    monad from the natural numbers. Being infinite in length, there is no 'Alternative' instance.
  .
  > data Stream a = a :< Stream a
  .
  * "Data.Stream.Infinite.Skew" provides an infinite skew-binary random-access-list with the semantics of "Data.Stream.Infinite"
    Since every stream is infinite, the 'Applicative' instance can be considerably less strict than the corresponding instance for
    "Data.Stream.Future.Skew" and performs asymptotically better.
  .
  >
  .
  * "Data.Stream.Infinite.Functional.Zipper" provides a bi-infinite sequence, represented as a pure function with an accumulating
    parameter added to optimize moving the current focus.
  .
  > data Zipper a = !Integer :~ (Integer -> a)
  .
  * "Data.Stream.Supply" provides a comonadic supply of unique values, which are
    generated impurely as the tree is explored.
