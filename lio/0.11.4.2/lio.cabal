Synopsis:       Labeled IO Information Flow Control Library
Category:       Security
Description:

  The /Labeled IO/ (LIO) library is an information flow control (IFC)
  library. IFC is a mechanism that enforces security policies by
  tracking and controlling the flow of information within a system.
  Unlike discretionary access control (such as UNIX file permissions),
  IFC permits scenarios in which untrusted computation may have the
  ability to manipulate secret data without having the ability to
  further disclose that data.

  .

  LIO is an IFC library that can be used to implement such untrusted
  computations.  LIO provides combinators similar to those of 'IO' for
  performing side-effecting computations (e.g., modifying mutable
  references, forking threads, throwing and catching exceptions, etc.)
  To track and control the flow of information, LIO associates a
  security policy, called a /label/, with every piece of data.  A
  label may, for example, impose a restriction on who can observe,
  propagate, or modify the data to which it applies.  Unlike standard
  IO operations, the LIO counterparts check the vailidity of labels
  before performing the (underlying IO) side-effecting computation.
  For example, before writing to a labeled variable, LIO asserts that
  the write will not violate any security policies associated with the
  data to be written.

  .

  Most code should import module "LIO" and whichever label format the
  application is using (e.g., "LIO.DCLabel" to use the format that
  ships with the library).  Side-effecting code should be specified as
  actions in the 'LIO' monad.  See "LIO.Core" for a description of the
  core library API, "LIO.Label" for a discussion of labels, and
  "LIO.Run" for functions allowing one to run an 'LIO' computation
  from the 'IO' monad.

  .

  WARNING:  For security, untrusted code must always be compiled with
  the @-XSafe@ and @-fpackage-trust@ /SafeHaskell/ flags. See
  <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/safe-haskell.html>
  for more details on the guarantees provided by SafeHaskell.
