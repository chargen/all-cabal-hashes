name:                trivial-constraint
version:             0.2.0.0
synopsis:            A class / constraint that any type fulfills
description:         Since GHC 7.4, constraints are first-class: we have the constraint kind, and thus type-classes have a kind such as @* -> Constraint@.
                     .
                     These can be used as parameters to data types. They also can be combined quite nicely,
                     .
                     @
                     type NewConstraint a = (Constraint1 a, Constraint2 a)
                     @
                     .
                     however you always need to start with a plain old type class when building constraints.
                     .
                     This library provides a type class that is not really a constraint at all, so you can "start from zero" with building up a custom constraint.
