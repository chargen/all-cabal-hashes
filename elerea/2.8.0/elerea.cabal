Name:                elerea
Version:             2.8.0
Cabal-Version:       >= 1.2
Synopsis:            A minimalistic FRP library
Category:            reactivity, FRP
Description:

 Elerea (Eventless reactivity) is a tiny discrete time FRP
 implementation without the notion of event-based switching and
 sampling, with first-class signals (time-varying values).  Reactivity
 is provided through various higher-order constructs that also allow
 the user to work with arbitrary time-varying structures containing
 live signals.  Signals have precise and simple denotational
 semantics.
 .
 Stateful signals can be safely generated at any time through a
 monadic interface, while stateless combinators can be used in a
 purely applicative style.  Elerea signals can be defined recursively,
 and external input is trivial to attach.  The library comes in three
 major variants:
 .
 * Simple: signals are plain discrete streams isomorphic to functions
   over natural numbers;
 .
 * Param: adds a globally accessible input signal for convenience;
 .
 * Clocked: adds the ability to freeze whole subnetworks at will.
 .
 This is a minimal library that defines only some basic primitives,
 and you are advised to install @elerea-examples@ as well to get an
 idea how to build non-trivial systems with it.  The examples are
 separated in order to minimise the dependencies of the core library.
 The @dow@ package contains a full game built on top of the simple
 variant.
 .
 The basic idea of the implementation is described in the WFLP 2010
 paper /Efficient and Compositional Higher-Order Streams/
 (<http://sgate.emt.bme.hu/documents/patai/publications/PataiWFLP2010.pdf>).
