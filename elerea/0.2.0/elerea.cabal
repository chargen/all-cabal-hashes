Name:                elerea
Version:             0.2.0
Cabal-Version:       >= 1.2
Synopsis:            A minimalistic FRP library
Category:            reactivity, FRP
Description:

 Elerea (Eventless reactivity) is a tiny continuous-time FRP
 implementation without the notion of event-based switching and
 sampling, with first-class signals (time-varying values). Reactivity
 is provided through a latching mechanism where a signal changes its
 behaviour as dictated by a boolean input signal.
 .
 Elerea provides an easy to use applicative interface, supports
 recursive signals (a definition like @sine = integral 0 (integral 1
 (-sine))@ works without a hitch) and arbitrary external input. Cyclic
 dependencies are detected on the fly and resolved by inserting delays
 dynamically, unless the user does it explicitly.
 .
 This is a minimal library that defines only some basic primitives,
 and you are advised to install @elerea-examples@ as well to get an
 idea how to build non-trivial systems with it. The examples are
 separated in order to minimise the dependencies of the core library.
