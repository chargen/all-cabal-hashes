-- The name of the package.
Name:                gdiff-th

-- The package version. See the Haskell package versioning policy
-- (http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Package_versioning_policy) for
-- standards guiding when and how versions should be incremented.
Version:             0.1.0.0

-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Generate gdiff GADTs and Instances.
-- A longer description of the package.
Description:  
    Generate gdiff GADTs and Instances. Alpha, but suprisingly functional. 
    Very useful for unit testing large data structures. I have tested it on a 
    few very large collections of types and it appears to work. Although, 
    when I tried to compare two versions of a hackage package with src-exts 
    the (GDiff) performance is terrible. In my personal experience of using
    gdiff in unit testing, the performance has be great. Your mileage may vary.
    .
    I wouldn't use it for sending patches over the wire or anything like that, 
    I am not convinced there are no bugs in my code yet. There are examples in the @examples@ directory of the 
    cabal tarball. Also the main module includes an example in the documentation.
    .    
    * New in this version: It's functional.
