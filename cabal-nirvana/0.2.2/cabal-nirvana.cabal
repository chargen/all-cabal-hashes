Name:                cabal-nirvana
Version:             0.2.2
Synopsis:            Avoid Cabal dependency hell by constraining to known good versions.
Description:         This tool takes a list of known compatible versions of libraries and forces them to be used. This should bypass a lot of cabal dependency hell, thereby inducing nirvana.
                     .
                     Originally, the idea was to use constraints in the Cabal config file to force this, but unfortunately there's a bug in cabal-install which prevents that from being possible. Instead, this tool now filters the list of available packages available.
                     .
                     The simplest usage is to just run cabal-nirvana. This will perform a few steps:
                     .
                     1. Perform a cabal update
                     .
                     2. Download the most recent version of the blessed package list.
                     .
                     3. Modify the list of packages downloaded in the cabal update by the list of blessed packages.
                     .
                     If you want to leave Nirvana, just perform a normal cabal update.
