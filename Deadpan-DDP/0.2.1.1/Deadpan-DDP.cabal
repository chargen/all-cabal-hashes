version:             0.2.1.1
synopsis:            Write clients for Meteor's DDP Protocol
description:         The Deadpan-DDP project includes a debugging-tool, as well as a general purpose library.
                     .
                     <https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/ddp/DDP.md DDP> is the protocol that
                     <http://meteor.com Meteor> speaks between client and server.
                     .
                     The DDP tech-stack is: Websockets -> JSON -> EJson -> Collections -> Subscriptions + RPC.
                     .
                     In order to use the debugging tool, install this package and run `deadpan` for a usage
                     statement.
                     .
                     In order to use the library, simply import "Web.DDP.Deadpan".
                     .
                     The DSL monad is largely based around RPC calls and callbacks.
                     In order to write an application you would call
                     `Web.DDP.Deadpan.runClient` with
                     .
                     * An initial application state (this includes initial callbacks)
                     * A set of connection parameters
                     * A `Web.DDP.Deadpan.DSL.Deadpan` application
                     .
                     There are several callback-sets provided in "Web.DDP.Deadpan",
                     however, if you want to pick in a more granular fashion,
                     look inside "Web.DDP.Deadpan.Callbacks".
                     .
                     The connection parameters are the triple (Domain, Port, Path)...
                     .
                     For convenience the function getURI is provided to turn a URI
                     of the form <websocket://localhost:3000/websocket>
                     into the triple (Right ("localhost", 3000, "websocket"))...
                     or an error (Left "error message").
                     .
