Name:                husk-scheme
Version:             2.1
Synopsis:            R5RS Scheme interpreter program and library.
Description:         Husk is a dialect of Scheme written in Haskell that implements 
                     a subset of the R5RS standard. Advanced R5RS features are
                     provided including continuations, hygenic macros, and the
                     full numeric tower.
                     
                     Husk is not intended to be a highly optimized version of Scheme. 
                     Rather, the goal of the project is to provide a tight integration 
                     between Haskell and Scheme while at the same time providing a 
                     great opportunity for deeper understanding of both languages. 
                     In addition, by closely following the R5RS standard, the intent is 
                     to develop a Scheme that is as compatible as possible with other 
                     R5RS Schemes.

                     This package includes a stand-alone executable as well as
                     a library that allows an interpreter to be embedded within an 
                     existing Haskell application.
