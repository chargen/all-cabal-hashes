synopsis:            derives heuristic rules from nominal data
description:         utility that reads a table in a csv (comma
                     separated) format that can be generated from
                     Open Office Calc (spreadsheet), derives all shortest rules
                     for a selected attribute, and writes them to a .csv file
                     that can be read by OO Calc. The shortest rules may be
                     partially ordered by implication (entailment) and equivalence
                     (equality) and the top level is also shown in .csv format.
                     Optionally all logical entailments and equalities are listed
                     as well. If the data set contains ambiguous rules or more
                     occurrences of the same rule the user is warned. Version 0.4
                     allows blank fields for values and has a Gtk2Hs based GUI.
