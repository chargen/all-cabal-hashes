description:
    Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. Amazon S3 has a
    simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any
    amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer
    access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage
    infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.
    The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on
    to developers.

    .
    /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    .
    /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under
    heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!
