description:
    Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. Amazon S3
    has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and
    retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It
    gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast,
    inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own
    global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of
    scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.
    .
    /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    .
    /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under
    heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!
