Synopsis:       Library for Apple Push Notification Service
Category:       Network
license:	BSD3
license-file:	LICENSE
Build-Type:     Simple
Description:    This library provides an interface to send notifications with the Apple Push Notification Service.
                
                .
                Note: Your connection to Apple's Push Notification service must be secured with SSL. Currently, Haskell's support
                for SSL is incomplete, therefore you should use an SSL tunnel to connect your application to the push service, such as                       stunnel.
