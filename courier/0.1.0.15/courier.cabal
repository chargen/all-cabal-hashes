name:                courier
version:             0.1.0.15
synopsis:           A message-passing library for simplifying network applications
description:         Inspired by Erlang's simple message-passing facilities, courier provides roughly similar 
                     capabilities. Applications simply create one or more endpoints, 
                     bind each to a transport using a given name, then can freely 
                     send / receive messages to other endpoints just by referencing the name each endpoint 
                     bound to its transport.
                     .
                     A primary driver of this package's design is separation of concerns: many algorithms
                     (especially for distributed applications) depend upon a message-passing foundation,
                     but the algorithms are sufficiently complex that the details of how those messages
                     are transmitted among nodes are best hidden away and solved separately from
                     the distributed algorithm itself.  With this in mind, this package aims
                     to provide a variety of transports as well as support for common communication
                     idioms (e.g., in order message delivery, selective out of order message delivery,
                     synchronous RPC, etc.). 
                     .
                     Applications may process messages in the order received at an endpoint, or use
                     selective message reception to process the first message arriving at an endpoint
                     that also matches a provided selection function. Through selective message reception,
                     applications may approximate the style of an Erlang application, and enjoy better 
                     composability of message reception with multiple independent dispatch routines or
                      message pumps.
