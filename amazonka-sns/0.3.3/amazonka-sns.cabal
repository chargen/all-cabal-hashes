description:
    Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fast, flexible, fully
    managed push messaging service. Amazon SNS makes it simple and cost-effective
    to push notifications to Apple, Google, Fire OS, and Windows devices, as well
    as Android devices in China with Baidu Cloud Push. You can also use SNS to
    push notifications to internet connected smart devices, as well as other
    distributed services. Besides pushing cloud notifications directly to mobile
    devices, Amazon SNS can also deliver notifications by SMS text message or
    email, to Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues, or to any HTTP endpoint.
    To prevent messages from being lost, all messages published to Amazon SNS are
    stored redundantly across multiple availability zones.

    .
    /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    .
    /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under
    heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!
