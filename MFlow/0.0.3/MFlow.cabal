description:  Simple application server with stateful request-response flows, persistent
              and transparent session handling. server process management, combinators for the definition of widgets
              and formlets that can be mixed freely with HTML formatting and produce statically
              typed web applications. Adopt and extend the best formlet/applicative Haskell traditions
              Console and window oriented apps are possible.
              .
              MFlow (MessageFlow) was created initially as the user interface for the Workflow package
            . Currently is an alpha version. It has
              only basic authentication but I plan to inprove it for serious applications.
           .
           Examples included
           .
           It includes Application Server features such is resource an process management
           and automatic recovery
           .
           Resource management: The user can define process and session timeout. The
           process is automatically rerun after timeout if a new request arrive with transparent
           recovery of state, at the point of the interrupted dialog  even after server crash.
           .
           The backend operation relies on the Workflow package ("http:\/\/hackage.haskell.org\/package\/Workflow/index"),
           this gives transparent sessión persistence and recovery, all of this
           is supported by
           TCache ("http:\/\/hackage.haskell.org\/package\/TCache/index"), that gives backend-independent transactions and can be used
           directly by the programmer. Persistence in files  for session and data out of the box enables
           very fast prototyping.
           .
           All the plumbing is hidden to the programmer, There is no methods for
           session management, database query, recovery and so on. All of this is
           transparent So the surface exposed to the programmer is minimal.
           .
           Includes generalized formlets that permits the mix of active widgets
           in the same page while remaining statically typed and, thus the programs
           can verify correctness at compilation time.
           .
           Includes combinators for seamless inclusion of these widgets within
           user defined HTML formatting. Bindings for Text.XHtml. The widget generation may be easy
           for user with familiarity with formlets/digestive functors and Text.XHtml formatting.
           .
           Currently it has bindings for the Hack  interface
           .
           Streaming facilities.
           .
           To do:
           .
           Bindings for HSP
           .
           Clustering
           .
           Other bindigs for Hack alternatives
