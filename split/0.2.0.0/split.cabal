Name:                split
Version:             0.2.0.0
Stability:           stable

Description:         A collection of various methods for splitting
                     lists into parts, akin to the \"split\" function
                     found in several mainstream languages. Here is
                     its tale:
                     .
                     Once upon a time the standard "Data.List" module
                     held no function for splitting a list into parts
                     according to a delimiter.  Many a brave
                     lambda-knight strove to add such a function, but
                     their striving was in vain, for Lo, the Supreme
                     Council fell to bickering amongst themselves what
                     was to be the essential nature of the One True
                     Function which could cleave a list in twain (or
                     thrain, or any required number of parts).
                     .
                     And thus came to pass the split package,
                     comprising divers functions for splitting a list
                     asunder, each according to its nature.  And the
                     Supreme Council had no longer any grounds for
                     argument, for the favored method of each was
                     contained therein.
                     .
                     To get started, see the "Data.List.Split" module.
