synopsis:
    Client library for the Redis datastore: supports full command set,  
    pipelining.
Description:
    Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to
    as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists,
    sets and sorted sets. This library is a Haskell client for the Redis
    datastore. Compared to other Haskell client libraries it has some
    advantages:
    .
    [Complete Redis 2.6 command set:] All Redis commands
        (<http://redis.io/commands>) are available as haskell functions, except
        for the MONITOR and SYNC commands. Additionally, a low-level API is
        exposed that  makes it easy for the library user to implement further
        commands, such as new commands from an experimental Redis version.
    .
    [Automatic Optimal Pipelining:] Commands are pipelined
        (<http://redis.io/topics/pipelining>) as much as possible without any
        work by the user. See
        <http://informatikr.com/2012/redis-pipelining.html> for a
        technical explanation of automatic optimal pipelining.
    .
    [Enforced Pub\/Sub semantics:] When subscribed to the Redis Pub\/Sub server
        (<http://redis.io/topics/pubsub>), clients are not allowed to issue
        commands other than subscribing to or unsubscribing from channels. This
        library uses the type system to enforce the correct behavior.
    .
    [Connect via TCP or Unix Domain Socket:] TCP sockets are the default way to
        connect to a Redis server. For connections to a server on the same
        machine, Unix domain sockets offer higher performance than the standard
        TCP connection.
    .
    For detailed documentation, see the "Database.Redis" module.
    .
    [Changes since version 0.5.1]
    .
    * Changed return type of HDEL from Bool to Integer.
    .
    * Some documentation updates.
    .
    [Changes since version 0.5]
    .
    * New commands: DUMP, RESTORE, BITOP, BITCOUNT.
    .
    * Removed the dependency on stm.
    .
    * Improved performance of Queued in long transactions.
    .
    * Minor documentation updates.
    .
    [Changes since version 0.4.1]
    .
    * Added new Redis 2.6 commands, including Lua scripting support.
    .
    * A transaction context is now created by using the 'multiExec' function.
      The functions 'multi', 'exec' and 'discard' are no longer available
      individually.
    .
    * Inside of a transaction, commands return their results wrapped in a
      composable /future/, called 'Queued'.
    .
    * The 'getType' command (the Redis TYPE command) now has a custom return
      type 'RedisType'.
    .
    * Minor improvements and fixes to the documentation.
    .
