description: Haskell bindings to the bcrypt password hash.

             Unlike other bindings already in existence, this package is designed to allow users to work directly with password hash strings that include information about the hashing algorithm, strength, and salt. This approach allows hashed passwords to be stored in a single field that can also be used by non-Haskell applications, and makes it easy to implement a policy of updating passwords hashed to an old policy next time the plaintext password is available.

             The OpenWall version of the C source for bcrypt (modified so it will build on all platforms without any assembler code) is included in this package.
