Cabal-Version: >= 1.6
Name: hexpat
Version: 0.18
Synopsis: XML parser/formatter based on expat
Description:
  This package provides a general purpose Haskell XML library using Expat to
  do its parsing (<http://expat.sourceforge.net/> - a fast stream-oriented XML
  parser written in C).  It is extensible to any string type, with @String@,
  @ByteString@ and @Text@ provided out of the box.
  .
  Basic usage: Parsing a tree (/Tree/), formatting a tree (/Format/).
  Other features: Helpers for processing XML trees (/Proc/), trees annotated with
  XML source location (/Annotated/), XML cursors (/Cursor/), SAX-style parse (/SAX/),
  and access to the low-level interface in case speed is paramount (/Internal.IO/).
  .
  The design goals are speed, speed, speed, interface simplicity and modularity.
  .
  For introduction and examples, see the /Text.XML.Expat.Tree/ module. For benchmarks,
  <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hexpat/>
  .
  If you want to do interactive I\/O, an obvious option is to use lazy parsing
  with one of the lazy I\/O functions such as hGetContents.  However, this can be
  problematic in some applications because it doesn't handle I\/O errors properly
  and can give no guarantee of timely resource cleanup.  In these cases, chunked
  I\/O is a better approach: Take a look at the /hexpat-iteratee/ package.
  .
  /IO/ is filed under /Internal/ because it's low-level and most users won't want
  it.  The other /Internal/ modules are re-exported by /Annotated/ and /Tree/,
  so you won't need to import them directly.
  .
  Credits to Iavor Diatchki and the @xml@ (XML.Light) package for /Proc/ and /Cursor/.
  .
  INSTALLATION: Unix install requires an OS package called something like @libexpat-dev@.
  On MacOSX, expat comes with Apple's optional X11 package, or you can install it from source.
  To install on Windows, first install the Windows binary that's available from
  <http://expat.sourceforge.net/>, then type (assuming you're using v2.0.1):
  .
  @cabal install hexpat --extra-lib-dirs="C:\\Program Files\\Expat 2.0.1\\Bin" --extra-include-dirs="C:\\Program Files\\Expat 2.0.1\\Source\\Lib"@
  .
  Ensure @libexpat.dll@ can be found in your system PATH (or copy it into your executable's directory).
  .
  ChangeLog: 0.15 changes intended to fix a (rare) \"error: a C finalizer called back into Haskell.\"
    that seemed only to happen only on ghc6.12.X; 0.15.1 Fix broken Annotated parse;
    0.16 switch from mtl to transformers; 0.17 fix mapNodeContainer & rename some things.;
    0.18 rename defaultEncoding to overrideEncoding.
