Synopsis:               For multiplexing GHC installations and providing
                        development sandboxes
Description:            This package provides a utility for multiplexing 
                        multiple GHC and Haskell Platform installations, 
                        each selected by an environment variable or a work-tree
                        configuration file.
                        .
                        The package also provides flexible development sandboxes 
                        (aka /hubs/) into which packages can be installed
                        and subsequently erased. Commands are provided for
                        (re)naming, annotating, replicating, swapping, archiving,
                        locking and removing hubs. E.g.,
                        .
                        > hub init
                        .
                        will create a hub based on the default GHC installation 
                        and associate the current directory with it. Any use
                        of /cabal/ or the GHC tools within this directory or it's
                        descendants will work with correct tool chain and the
                        private user-package database belonging to the hub. 
                        .
                        The following would (i) download 'hexpat' (ii) install it
                        in a named 'hexpat-test' hub connected to the /2011.2.0.1/
                        Haskell Platform, (iii) build the 'hexpat' test suite 
                        with the same hub, and (iv) finally run the test suite.
                        .
                        >cabal unpack hexpat
                        >cd hexpat-*
                        >hub init -s 2011.2.0.1 hexpat-test
                        >cabal install
                        >cd test
                        >cabal install --bindir=.
                        >./testsuite 
                        .
                        This same 'hexpat-test' hub can be shared with other
                        work trees.
                        .
                        The tool is intended to be provided as part of a
                        distribution (like the /JustHub/ Enterprise Linux
                        distribution) but it can be configured with existing
                        stock GHC installations without too much effort.  Once
                        installed and configured the hub command  inter-operates
                        seamlessly with the GHC tools (/ghc/, /ghci/, /ghc-pkg/,
                        etc.) and /Cabal-install/.
                        .
