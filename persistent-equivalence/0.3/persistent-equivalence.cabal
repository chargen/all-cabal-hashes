Name:                persistent-equivalence
Version:             0.3
Synopsis:            Persistent equivalence relations (aka union-find)
Description:         This is a persistent data structure for equivalence
                     relations (known in the imperative world as union-find
                     or disjoint set union).  It exhibits optimal performance
                     when used in a linear pattern, but degrades when other
                     access patterns are used.
                     .
                     The basic idea is as given by Conchon and Filliatre in
                     their 2007 paper, \"A persistent union-find data
                     structure.\"  Unlike the implementation given in the
                     paper, this version is safe with multiple threads, but
                     does not optimize for backtracking.
                     .
                     Version 0.3 contains some performance improvements for
                     concurrent applications, and removes the 'repr' function,
                     which was poorly defined and had no good uses.
