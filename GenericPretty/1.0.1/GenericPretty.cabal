-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            A generic, derivable, haskell pretty printer.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description: GenericPretty is a haskell library that provides support for automatic
	derivation of pretty printing functions on user defined data types.
	The Pretty library <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.0.4/html/libraries/ghc-7.0.4/Pretty.html>
  is used underneath, the work is done over 'Pretty.Doc' types.
	.	
	The output provided by the library functions is identical to that of Prelude.show, 
	except it has extra whitespace.
	.	
	This requires the use of the new GHC.Generics features: <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Generics>.
	As of 9.08.2011, these aren't present in the stable GHC releases, but 
  seem to be present in the GHC HEAD development snapshots >= 7.1.20110601.
	.
	The Generics used are based on those described in the paper "A Generic Deriving Mechanism for Haskell" : 
	<http://dreixel.net/research/pdf/gdmh.pdf> . The changes from the original paper on the ghc implementation
	are described here: <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Generics#Changes_from_the_paper>.
	.
	For more info and examples of usage please see the README file included  in the package 
  and the API at <http://haggismcmutton.github.com/GenericPretty/>
  .
  Installation of the package is straightforward, if needed, instructions can be found,
  for instance, here: <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal/How_to_install_a_Cabal_package>.
