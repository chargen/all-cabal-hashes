synopsis: A package for configuring and building Haskell software
description: 
        Franchise is an easy-to use package for building Haskell
        software.  Unlike Cabal, you aren't required to track every
        possible dependency in every possible build condition.  In
        addition, you are not required to use an external tool such as
        autoconf in order to configure the build based on which
        packages, libraries and tools are present.

        Note: the cabal dependencies are autogenerated, and approximate.
