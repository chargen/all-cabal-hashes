Synopsis:      Network abstraction layer 
Description:   "Network.Transport" is a Network Abstraction Layer which provides
               the following high-level concepts:
               .
                 * Nodes in the network are represented by 'EndPoint's. These are
                   heavyweight stateful objects.
               .
                 * Each 'EndPoint' has an 'EndPointAddress'.
               .
                 * Connections can be established from one 'EndPoint' to another
                   using the 'EndPointAddress' of the remote end.
               .
                 * The 'EndPointAddress' can be serialised and sent over the
                   network, where as 'EndPoint's and connections cannot.
               .
                 * Connections between 'EndPoint's are unidirectional and lightweight.
               .
                 * Outgoing messages are sent via a 'Connection' object that
                   represents the sending end of the connection.
               .
                 * Incoming messages for /all/ of the incoming connections on
                   an 'EndPoint' are collected via a shared receive queue.
               .
                 * In addition to incoming messages, 'EndPoint's are notified of
                   other 'Event's such as new connections or broken connections.
               . 
               This design was heavily influenced by the design of the Common
               Communication Interface
               (<http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/common-communication-interface>).
               Important design goals are:
               .     
               * Connections should be lightweight: it should be no problem to
                 create thousands of connections between endpoints.
               .
               * Error handling is explicit: every function declares as part of
                 its type which errors it can return (no exceptions are thrown)
               .
               * Error handling is "abstract": errors that originate from
                 implementation specific problems (such as "no more sockets" in
                 the TCP implementation) get mapped to generic errors
                 ("insufficient resources") at the Transport level.  
               .
               This package provides the generic interface only; you will
               probably also want to install at least one transport
               implementation (network-transport-*).
