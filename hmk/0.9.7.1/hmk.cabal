name:           hmk
version:        0.9.7.1
author:         Mathieu Boespflug
maintainer:     Mathieu Boespflug <mboes@tweag.net>
homepage:       http://www.github.com/mboes/hmk
synopsis:       A make alternative based on Plan9's mk.
description:
        Clone of Plan9's mk command, said to have \"improved on make by
        removing all the vowels from the name\". Most features of mk
        are implemented, including basic meta-rules support and
        concurrent execution of jobs.
        .
        The library exports a generic dependency graph traversal that
        can be used independently of the rest.
        .
        The documentation is embedded in the literate Haskell source.
        .
        /Note:/ the library portion is released to the /public domain/.
        Those source files that are not part of the library
        are released under GPLv3 or later.
