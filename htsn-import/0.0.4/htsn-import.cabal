synopsis:
  Import XML files from The Sports Network into an RDBMS.
description:
  /Usage/:
  .
  @
  htsn-import [OPTIONS] [FILES]
  @
  .
  The Sports Network <http://www.sportsnetwork.com/> offers an XML feed
  containing various sports news and statistics. Our sister program
  /htsn/ is capable of retrieving the feed and saving the individual
  XML documents contained therein. But what to do with them?
  .
  The purpose of /htsn-import/ is to take these XML documents and
  get them into something we can use, a relational database management
  system (RDBMS), loosely known as a SQL database. The structure of
  relational database, is, well, relational, and the feed XML is not. So
  there is some work to do before the data can be inserted.
  .
  First, we must parse the XML. Each supported document type (see below)
  has a full pickle/unpickle implementation (\"pickle\" is simply a
  synonym for serialize here). That means that we parse the entire
  document into a data structure, and if we pickle (serialize) that data
  structure, we get the exact same XML document tha we started with.
  .
  This is important for two reasons. First, it serves as a second level
  of validation. The first validation is performed by the XML parser,
  but if that succeeds and unpicking fails, we know that something is
  fishy. Second, we don't ever want to be surprised by some new element
  or attribute showing up in the XML. The fact that we can unpickle the
  whole thing now means that we won't be surprised in the future.
  .
  The aforementioned feature is especially important because we
  automatically migrate the database schema every time we import a
  document. If you attempt to import a \"newsxml.dtd\" document, all
  database objects relating to the news will be created if they do not
  exist. We don't want the schema to change out from under us without
  warning, so it's important that no XML be parsed that would result in
  a different schema than we had previously. Since we can
  pickle/unpickle everything already, this should be impossible.
  .
  Examples and usage documentation are available in the man page.
