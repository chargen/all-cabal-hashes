Description:         Bindings to L-BFGS-B, Fortran code for limited-memory quasi-Newton bound-constrained optimization.
                     .
		     L-BFGS-B is a Fortran library for limited-memory quasi-Newton bound-constrained optimization written
		     by Ciyou Zhu, Richard Byrd, Jorge Nocedal and Jose Luis Morales. More information can be found on its
		     homepage <http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html>, or in [1].
                     .
                     The L-BFGS-B Fortran code is not included in this package, as I consider it a dependency. This package expects to
		     be able to link against version 3.0 of the L-BFGS-B code, as built by a relatively recent version of gfortran.
                     Instructions on how to build L-BFGS-B as a shared library
                     can be found at <http://nonempty.org/software/haskell-l-bfgs-b>.
		     .
                     The functions provided in this package wrap FFI calls in 'unsafePerformIO', which among other things means that
                     the called L-BFGS-B code should not output anything. The relevant @iprint@ flag is thus set negative to suppress
                     output as specified in the L-BFGS-B code. However, there are two places in said code where the flag is ignored
                     and output still occurs. If it bothers you that code exposed as pure prints things, see 
                     <http://nonempty.org/software/haskell-l-bfgs-b> for information on a simple patch for L-BFGS-B. The SciPy project
                     has described the same behavior at <http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/ticket/1742>.
                     .
		     Example on usage can be found in the included @examples@ directiory.
                     .
                     The current version has only been lightly tested, and should not be trusted for serious work. Feedback is appreciated.
                     .

		     * There has only been cursory testing, so do not trust these bindings yet.
		     .
                     * Initial release.
