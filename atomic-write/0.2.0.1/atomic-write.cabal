synopsis:            Atomically write to a file

description:
  .
  Atomically write to a file on POSIX-compliant systems while preserving
  permissions.
  .
  On most Unix systems, `mv` is an atomic operation. This makes it simple to write
  to a file atomically just by using the mv operation. However, this will
  destroy the permissions on the original file. This library does the following
  to preserve permissions while atomically writing to a file:
  .
  * If an original file exists, take those permissions and apply them to the
    temp file before `mv`ing the file into place.
  .
  * If the original file does not exist, create a following with default
    permissions (based on the currently-active umask).
  .
  This way, when the file is `mv`'ed into place, the permissions will be the ones
  held by the original file.
  .
  This library is based on similar implementations found in common libraries in
  Ruby and Python:
  .
  * <http://apidock.com/rails/File/atomic_write/class Ruby on Rails includes a similar method called atomic_write>
  .
  * <https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/c4631816132fcfefaba3d123a1d0dfe8bc2866bb/lib/chef/file_content_management/deploy/mv_unix.rb#L23:L71 Chef includes atomic update functionality>
  .
  * <https://github.com/sashka/atomicfile There is a python library for atomically updating a file>
  .
  At this time Windows is not supported, however we would appreciate
  contributions to the <http://github.com/stackbuilders/atomic-write github repository>.
  .
  To use `atomic-write`, import the module corresponding to the type you wish to
  write atomically, e.g., to write a (strict) ByteString atomically:
  .
  > import System.AtomicWrite.Writer.ByteString
  .
  Then you can use the atomicWrite function that accepts a `FilePath` and a
  `ByteString`, e.g.:
  .
  > atomicWrite myFilePath myByteString
