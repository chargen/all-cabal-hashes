description: 
    This package provides various representations of musical pitch.
    .
    Note that this package is independent of @music-score@ and vice versa.
    This is a deliberate design choice: the user should be free to combine any
    pitch representation with any time structure. Normally you will include
    both packages through @music-preludes@.
    .
    This library is part of the Music Suite, see
    <http://music-suite.github.io>.
