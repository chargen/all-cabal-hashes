Name:                kmeans-vector
Version:             0.1.1
Synopsis:            An implementation of the kmeans clustering algorithm based on the vector package
Description:         Provides a simple (but efficient) implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm. The goal of this algorithm is to, given a list of n-dimensional points, regroup them in k groups, such that each point gets to be in the group to which it is the closest to (using the 'center' of the group). 
		     .
		     Sample output (after some gnuplot hackery -- see the tests dir in the repository): <http://i.imgur.com/IpIPC.png>
		     .
		     Expect some improvements on the initial clustering, thus resulting in a better clustering, for future versions.
