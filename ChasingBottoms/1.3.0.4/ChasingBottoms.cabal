description:
  Do you ever feel the need to test code involving bottoms (e.g. calls to
  the @error@ function), or code involving infinite values? Then this
  library could be useful for you.
  .
  It is usually easy to get a grip on bottoms by showing a value and
  waiting to see how much gets printed before the first exception is
  encountered. However, that quickly gets tiresome and is hard to automate
  using e.g. QuickCheck
  (<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/>). With this library you
  can do the tests as simply as the following examples show.
  .
  Testing explicitly for bottoms:
  .
    [@> isBottom (head [\])@] @True@
  .
    [@> isBottom bottom@] @True@
  .
    [@> isBottom (\\_ -> bottom)@] @False@
  .
    [@> isBottom (bottom, bottom)@] @False@
  .
  Comparing finite, partial values:
  .
    [@> ((bottom, 3) :: (Bool, Int)) ==! (bottom, 2+5-4)@] @True@
  .
    [@> ((bottom, bottom) :: (Bool, Int)) <! (bottom, 8)@] @True@
  .
  Showing partial and infinite values (@\\\/!@ is join and @\/\\!@ is meet):
  .
    [@> approxShow 4 $ (True, bottom) \\\/! (bottom, \'b\')@] @\"Just (True, \'b\')\"@
  .
    [@> approxShow 4 $ (True, bottom) \/\\! (bottom, \'b\')@] @\"(_|_, _|_)\"@
  .
    [@> approxShow 4 $ ([1..\] :: [Int\])@] @\"[1, 2, 3, _\"@
  .
    [@> approxShow 4 $ (cycle [bottom\] :: [Bool\])@] @\"[_|_, _|_, _|_, _\"@
  .
  Approximately comparing infinite, partial values:
  .
    [@> approx 100 [2,4..\] ==! approx 100 (filter even [1..\] :: [Int\])@] @True@
  .
    [@> approx 100 [2,4..\] \/=! approx 100 (filter even [bottom..\] :: [Int\])@] @True@
  .
  The code above relies on the fact that @bottom@, just as @error
  \"...\"@, @undefined@ and pattern match failures, yield
  exceptions. Sometimes we are dealing with properly non-terminating
  computations, such as the following example, and then it can be nice to
  be able to apply a time-out:
  .
    [@> timeOut' 1 (reverse [1..5\])@] @Value [5,4,3,2,1]@
  .
    [@> timeOut' 1 (reverse [1..\])@] @NonTermination@
  .
  The time-out functionality can be used to treat \"slow\" computations as
  bottoms:
  .
    [@> let tweak = Tweak &#x7b; approxDepth = Just 5, timeOutLimit = Just 2 &#x7d;@]
  .
    [@> semanticEq tweak (reverse [1..\], [1..\]) (bottom :: [Int\], [1..\] :: [Int\])@] @True@
  .
    [@> let tweak = noTweak &#x7b; timeOutLimit = Just 2 &#x7d;@]
  .
    [@> semanticJoin tweak (reverse [1..\], True) ([\] :: [Int\], bottom)@] @Just ([],True)@
  .
  This can of course be dangerous:
  .
    [@> let tweak = noTweak &#x7b; timeOutLimit = Just 0 &#x7d;@]
  .
    [@> semanticEq tweak (reverse [1..100000000\]) (bottom :: [Integer\])@] @True@
  .
  Timeouts can also be applied to @IO@ computations:
  .
    [@> let primes = unfoldr (\\(x:xs) -> Just (x, filter ((\/= 0) . (\`mod\` x)) xs)) [2..\]@]
  .
    [@> timeOutMicro 100 (print $ filter ((== 1) . (\`mod\` 83)) primes)@] @[167,499,9NonTermination@
  .
    [@> timeOutMicro 100 (print $ take 6 $ filter ((== 1) . (\`mod\` 83)) primes)@] @[167,499,997,1163,1993NonTermination@
  .
    [@> timeOutMicro 100 (print $ take 6 $ filter ((== 1) . (\`mod\` 83)) primes)@] @[167,499,997,1163,1993,2657]@
  .
    [@ @] @Value ()@
  .
  For the underlying theory and a larger example involving use of
  QuickCheck, see the article \"Chasing Bottoms, A Case Study in Program
  Verification in the Presence of Partial and Infinite Values\"
  (<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/publications/danielsson-jansson-mpc2004.html>).
  .
  The code has been tested using GHC. Most parts can probably be
  ported to other Haskell compilers, but this would require some work.
  The @TimeOut@ functions require preemptive scheduling, and most of
  the rest requires @Data.Generics@; @isBottom@ only requires
  exceptions, though.
