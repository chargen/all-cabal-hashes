Name:                church-list
Version:             0.0.1
Synopsis:            Lazy lists with O(1) concatenation that, unlike dlists, allow inspection
License-file:        LICENSE
License:             MIT
Author:              John Wiegley
Maintainer:          johnw@newartisans.com
Build-Type:          Simple
Cabal-Version:       >=1.10
Category:            System
Description:
  Replicates the @Data.List@ interface for lists built around the type @forall
  r. Monoid r => (a -> r) -> r@.  This allows for O(1) concatenation and snoc,
  just as difference lists do, but without requiring that every operation
  (such as map) render the list.
  .
  As motivation: Although difference lists are great for use with Writer, they
  are horrible for use with State, because getting the list and querying an
  element will result in producing a structure which is thrown away.  With
  mlists, you can both append to, and inspect, the list in progress without
  any wasted work.
