Synopsis:       Image editor for pixel art
Description:    BigPixel is an image editor for pixel art. It is aimed at creating graphics assets for retro or
                Minecraft-style 2D games. It supports the creation of pixelated images with 8x8 big pixels in
                256 colours with 16 levels of transparency. It is an OpenGL-based cross-platform application.
                BigPixel currently only supports the BMP image format.
                
                As BigPixel is a plain OpenGL application without platform-specific GUI support, you need to start
                it as a command line program and supply it with the name of a BMP image file as its sole command
                line argument. If the file exists, it will be opened for editing; otherwise, a new file will be
                created. All changes made to an image are persistent — i.e., reflected in the on disk image without
                explicit saving.
                
                > Left mouse button          — draw with current colour
                > Left mouse button + Shift  — erase with transparency
                > Right mouse button         — erase with transparency
                > 'W', 'S', 'A', 'D'         - enlarge canvas to the top, bottom, left, and right, respectively
                > 'W', 'S', 'A', 'D' + Shift - shrink canvas from the top, bottom, left, and right, respectively
                
                WARNING: There is currently no undo facility! Make copies of image files if you are unsure whether
                you like to keep the changes. (However, if you shrink the visible canvas, the removed content can
                be restored by simply enlarging the canvas again.)
