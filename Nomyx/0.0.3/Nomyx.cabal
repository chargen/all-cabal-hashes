synopsis: A Nomic game in haskell, featuring automatic, machine-executed rules written by the players
description: A Nomic game in Haskell, with a dedicated language to create new rules.
             .
             Nomyx is a fabulous and strange game where you have the right to change the rules in the middle of the game!
             Indeed, changing the rules is the goal of the game. Changing a rule is considered as a move. Of course even that could be changed! The original (paper) game: www.nomic.net
