Name:               cuboid 
Category:           Game
Description:

    A simple 3D puzzle game made with Yampa and GLUT.  The objective
    of the game is to get the red sphere to the green sphere, by
    moving the red sphere.
    .
    Use the W and D keys to rotate the cube, and the arrow keys
    (up\/down\/left\/right), to move the red ball (front\/back\/left\/right
    respectively).  The red sphere will then move until it hits an
    obstacle (green cube) and then stops.
    .
    In order to add levels check out Game.hs. If you come up with
    a great level do send it to me. I plan to extract the levels
    into a configuration file in the future.
    .
    A slightly modified version of Yampa was included, which exports
    the constructors that allow building new complex stateful operators
