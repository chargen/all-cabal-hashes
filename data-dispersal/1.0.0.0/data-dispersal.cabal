synopsis:            Space-efficient and privacy-preserving data dispersal algorithms.

description:
  This library provides space-efficient (m,n)-information dispersal algorithms (IDAs). 
  .
  Given a ByteString @bstr@ of length @D@, we encode @bstr@ as a list @fs@ of @n@ 
  'Fragment's, each containing a ByteString
  of length @O(D/m)@. Then, each fragment in @fs@ could be stored on a separate 
  machine for fault-tolerance.
  Even if up to @n-m@ of these machines crash, we can still reconstruct the original 
  ByteString out of the remaining m fragments.
  The total space required for the n fragments is @O((n/m)*D)@.
  Note that @m@ and @n@ are roughly in the same order, so the actual storage overhead 
  for getting good fault-tolerance increases only by a constant factor.
  .
  The module @Data.IDA@ contains the basic information dispersal algorithm. The module
  @Crypto.IDA@ augments the dispersal scheme by combining it with secret sharing, i.e.,
  the knowledge of up to @m-1@ fragments does not leak any information about
  the original data. See "Crypto.IDA" for details.

  /Fault-Tolerance:/
  .
  Suppose that we have @N@ machines and encode our data as @2log(N)@ fragments 
  with reconstruction threshold m = @log(N)@.
  Let's assume that we store each fragment on a separate machine and each
  machine fails (independently) with probability at most 0.5.
  .
  * What is the probability of our data being safe? 
  @Pr[ at most n-m machines crash ] >= 1-0.5^(log(N)) = 1-N^(-1).@
  .
  * What is the overhead in terms of space that we pay for this level of fault-tolerance?
  We have n fragments, each of size D\/m, so the total space is @n * D\/ m = 
  2D.@
  In other words, we can guarantee that the data survives with high probability 
  by increasing the required space by a constant factor.
  .
