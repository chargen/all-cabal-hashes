name:                diophantine
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            A quadratic diophantine equation solving library.
description:
    A library for solving quadratic diophantine equations.
    .
    This library is designed to solve for equations where:
    .
      * the form is: ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0
    .
      * a,b,c,d,e,f are integers.
    .
      * soltutions are restricted to x and y are also integers.
    .
    This library breaks down equations based on their type to solve them most
    efficiently. This library supports linear, simple hyperbolic, eliptical, and
    parabolic equations, with hyperbolics on the way.
    .
