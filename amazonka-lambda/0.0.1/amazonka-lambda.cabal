description:
    AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to
    events and automatically manages the compute resources for you, making
    it easy to build applications that respond quickly to new information.
    AWS Lambda starts running your code within milliseconds of an event
    such as an image upload, in-app activity, website click, or output from
    a connected device. You can also use AWS Lambda to create new back-end
    services where compute resources are automatically triggered based on
    custom requests. With AWS Lambda you pay only for the requests served
    and the compute time required to run your code. Billing is metered in
    increments of 100 milliseconds, making it cost-effective and easy to
    scale automatically from a few requests per day to thousands per
    second.
