description:
                A data structure for Mathews / Turner RNA and DNA energy
                parameters. This library currently only provides an importer,
                not export functions. There are two reasons: (i) We currently
                have no use-case where we need more than import facilities (ii)
                The file structure is geared towards humans, not machines. If
                you need to be able to export, send a mail.
                .
                This is the 2011 post-library split version, hence not
                deprecated anymore.
                .
                NOTE This is rather fragile as some files use different index
                enumerations, which we handle rather... simplistically. We
                cannot fix one asymmetry case in dnastack.dh, as we do not
                change sources.
                .
                BIG FAT WARNING indexing now depends on repa shapes and index
                representations. (with a good reason coming soon). For now,
                just assume that this has performance benefits.
