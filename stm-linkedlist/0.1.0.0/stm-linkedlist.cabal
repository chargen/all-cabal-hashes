name:                stm-linkedlist
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Mutable, doubly linked lists for STM
description:
    Doubly linked lists are often used in imperative languages to maintain a
    collection of objects such that an object can remove itself easily.  The
    same idea applies here.  Thanks to STM, these lists can be shared among
    threads with little effort.
    .
    Suppose you have a thread listening for events.  You want to dispatch
    events to any thread that opts in.  You could write a function that
    installs an event handler, performs an action, and removes the handler:
    .
    >withEventHandler list handler action =
    >    bracket (atomically $ LinkedList.append handler list)
    >            (atomically . LinkedList.delete)
    >            (\_ -> action)
    .
    Then, you could have your listener thread dispatch events using a function
    like this:
    .
    >dispatchEvent list event = do
    >    handlers <- atomically $ LinkedList.toList list
    >    forM_ handlers $ \handler -> handler event
