-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            A CTCP encoding and decoding library for IRC clients.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
  CTCP (Client To Client Protocol) is a way of sending arbitrary data
  over an IRC network, which may include bytes not allowed in standard
  IRC messages. CTCPs are sent as a PRIVMSG or NOTICE, where the first
  and last characters as @\\001@ (SOH), and special bytes are escaped
  by encoding them into a two-byte sequence beginning with @\\020@
  (DLE). CTCPs consist of command name (typically in upper-case)
  followed by list of space-separated arguments, which may be empty.
  .
  One use of CTCPs supported by the vast majority of IRC clients today
  is the ACTION command, typically invoked with /me. For example, if
  the user @foo@ in the channel @#bar@ were to issue
  .
  > /me dances
  .
  everyone in the channel would receive the message
  .
  > :foo PRIVMSG #bar :\001ACTION dances\001
  .
  Other common uses of CTCP include requesting the name and version of
  a user's IRC client, their local time, determining ping times, and
  initiating file transfers (DCC).
  .
  Characters are escaped as follows:
  .
     [@\\000@ (NUL)] @\\020 \\060@ ("0")
  .
     [@\\012@ (NL)]  @\\020 \\156@ ("n")
  .
     [@\\015@ (CR)]  @\\020 \\162@ ("r")
  .
     [@\\020@ (DLE)] @\\020 \\020@
  .
  All other appearences of the escape character are errors, and are
  dropped.
  .
  See <http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html> for more
  details.
