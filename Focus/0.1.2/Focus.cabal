Synopsis:      Tools for focusing in on locations within numbers
Description:   Focuses are lists of numbers where longer lists are treated as
               'focuses' on their parent lists. As such, `Focus []` is
               considered "unfocused" (it is EQ to all focuses), `Focus [1, 1]`
               is EQ to `Focus [1, 1, 3]` because their roots are equal, and so
               on. This isn't useful for testing true equality, but it is quite
               useful for traversing and pruning indexed rose trees from one
               locus to another.
