description:
  Hurdle - (H)askell (U)tilty (R)egarding (DL)l (E)xports.
  .
  Extract function names from Windows DLLs a-la pexports.
  . 
  Hurdle has minimal dependencies: base, containers, pretty and 
  kangaroo (kangaroo just needs base and array).
  .
  Currently Hurdle also has minimal utility - please consider 
  pexports instead as Hurdle doesn't yet print ordinals 
  and fails on DLLs generated by Visual C++ (Hurdle was a Sunday 
  afternoon hack that took a wee bit longer). But... if anyone 
  has a compelling use case that would benefit the community, I'm 
  willing to look at extending Hurdle.
  .
  Change-log
  .
  0.1.0 to 0.2.0 
  .
  * Changed to use kangaroo binary parser combinators.
  * Added error message reporting parser failure when 
    .edata section is not found.
