-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Tools and a library for working with Trajectory.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         Trajectory <http://apptrajectory.com/> is a project
                     estimation and management tool for project managers,
                     product managers, developers, and designers. It is heavily
                     inspired by, but improves upon, Basecamp and Pivotal
                     Tracker. Like Basecamp, it has a place to organize ideas
                     and exchange free-form feedback; like Pivotal Tracker it
                     has the concept of stories with points instead of time
                     estimations, and it calculates time estimations based on
                     past performance. It also weds the two concepts,
                     connecting stories with ideas.
                     .
                     This is a collection of tools and libraries for interacting with Trajectory.
                     .
                     It provides the @lsstory@ tool, a command-line app that
                     can list stories, filtering by source idea, milestone,
                     point, assignment, whether design or development is
                     needed; it can filter on the state (unstarted, started,
                     finished, done); it can filter on the iteration. It can
                     also be used simply to tell you the next unstarted,
                     unassigned development story to work on.
                     .
                     To build more with this package, look into the
                     @Trajectory.API@ module.
                     .
