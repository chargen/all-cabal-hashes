description:

    docidx is a small tool which creates an HTML index of your
    installed Haskell packages, with links to each package's Haddock
    docs locally and on Hackage.  While "cabal install" now creates
    and maintains an index by module, sometimes it's nice to have this
    other view (and the quick links to Hackage).

    docidx queries your global and user package databases (via
    ghc-pkg, via the Cabal package), to build an index of all
    installed packages - including version numbers where more than one
    version is present, package synopses, links to the local Haddock
    docs, and a link to the package on Hackage.

    Packages are grouped by first letter, and there's an A-Z index at
    the top of the page, which can be easily extended via a config
    file to include extra links you think are handy - e.g. to the
    per-module index, to local ghc documentation, to the Haskell
    report, etc. - whatever you want).
