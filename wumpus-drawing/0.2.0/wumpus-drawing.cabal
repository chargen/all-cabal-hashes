synopsis:         High-level drawing objects built on Wumpus-Basic.
description:
  .
  \*\* WARNING \*\* - this package is sub-alpha. Although many of 
  the drawing objects have been improved since the code was split 
  from Wumpus-Basic, the code is still prototypical. Essentially
  this package is a /technology preview/ and not a re-usable 
  library.
  .
  NOTE - many of the demos use font metrics. Font metrics for
  the \"Core 14\" PostScript fonts are distributed as @*.afm@ 
  files with GhostScript in the @fonts@ directory. Wumpus expects
  the GhostScript font metrics to be AFM version 2.0 files (this
  matches GhostScript 8.63). Alternatively, metrics for the Core 
  14 fonts are available from Adode (AFM version 4.1), see the 
  links below. To run the demos properly you will need one of 
  these sets of metrics.
  .

  .
  Core 14 AFM metrics:
  <https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/font/pdfs/Core14_AFMs.tar>
  .
  Also note that Wumpus uses fallback metrics (derived from the
  monospaced Courier font) when font loading fails, rather than
  throwing a terminal error. Applications should ideally check
  the font loading log to ensure that fonts have loaded correctly
  (the demos print this log to standard out).
  .
  Changelog:
  .
  v0.1.0 to 0.2.0:
  .
  * Added new Shapes.
  .
  * Move Geometry modules to Wumpus-Basic.
  .
  * Re-implemented Chains.
  .
  * Re-implemented LR-Text. Added CatText.
  .
  v0.1.0:
  .
  * Initial release - this is a split from @Wumpus-Basic@ making 
    the (very prototypical - read sub-alpha, unstable...) modules 
    in the @Drawing@ hierarchy a separate package.
  .
  * Simplified Chains - chains are now regular lists (though often
    infinite). Drawings are made with chains using new zip-like
    functions.
  .
  * Re-worked Shapes.
  .
  * Re-worked Arrow and Arrow Tip types.
  .
  * Re-worked ConnectorPaths.
  .
