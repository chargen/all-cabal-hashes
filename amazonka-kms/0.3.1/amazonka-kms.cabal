description:
    Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy
    for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data,
    and uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of your
    keys. Amazon Key Management Service is integrated with other Amazon services
    including Amazon EBS, Amazon S3, and Amazon Redshift. Amazon Key Management
    Service is also integrated with Amazon CloudTrail to provide you with logs of
    all key usage to help meet your regulatory and compliance needs.
