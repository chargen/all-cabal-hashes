description:
    Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that makes it
    easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt
    your data, and uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the
    security of your keys. Amazon Key Management Service is integrated with
    other Amazon services including Amazon EBS, Amazon S3, and Amazon
    Redshift. Amazon Key Management Service is also integrated with Amazon
    CloudTrail to provide you with logs of all key usage to help meet your
    regulatory and compliance needs.
