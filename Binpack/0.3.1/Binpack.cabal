Synopsis:           Common bin packing heuristics
Description:

  An implementation of the first-fit, modified-first-fit, last-fit, best-fit,
  worst-fit, and almost-last-fit bin packing heuristics. Items can be packed in
  order of both decreasing and increasing size (and, of course, in unmodified
  order).
  .
  The module supports both the standard (textbook) minimization problem
  (/How many bins do I need?/) and the more practical fitting problem
  (/I've got n bins; which items can I take?/).
  .
  The API is simple and the module is documented with Haddock (complete with
  examples). The implementation of the above-mentioned heuristics is complete
  and partially tested with QuickCheck. However, note that speed has not been a
  primary concern to date.
  .
  Patches and feedback are very welcome.
