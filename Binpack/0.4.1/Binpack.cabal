Build-Type:         Simple
Synopsis:           Common bin-packing heuristics.
Description:

  An implementation of the first-fit, modified-first-fit, last-fit, best-fit,
  sum-of-squares-fit, worst-fit, and almost-last-fit bin packing
  heuristics. Items can be packed in order of both decreasing and increasing
  size (and, of course, in unmodified order).
  .
  The module supports both the standard (textbook) minimization problem
  (/How many bins do I need?/) and the more practical fitting problem
  (/I've got n bins; which items can I take?/).
  .
  The API is simple and the module is documented with Haddock (complete with
  examples). The implementation of the above-mentioned heuristics is complete
  and partially tested with QuickCheck. However, note that speed has not been a
  primary concern to date.
  .
  Patches and feedback are very welcome.
