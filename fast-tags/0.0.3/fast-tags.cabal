name: fast-tags
version: 0.0.3
cabal-version: >= 1.8
build-type: Simple
synopsis: Fast incremental vi tags.
description:
    Yet another tags program.  Like hasktags, it uses its own parser rather
    than haskell-src or haskell-src-exts, so it's fast.  It understands
    hsc files, though not literate haskell.
    .
    In addition, it will load an existing tags file and merge generated tags.
    .
    The intent is to bind it to vim's BufWrite autocommand to automatically
    keep the tags file up to date.
    .
    Changes since 0.0.2:
    .
    * Lots of speed ups, especially when given lots of files at once.
    .
    * Support for type families and GADTs.
    .
    * Support infix operators, multiple declarations per line, and fix various
    other bugs that missed or gave bad tags.
    .
    Limitations:
    .
    - No emacs tags, but they would be easy to add.
    .
    - Not using a real haskell parser means there are more likely to be dark
    corners that don't parse right.
    .
    - Only top-level functions with type declarations are tagged.  Top-level
    functions without type declarations are skipped, as are ones inside 'let'
    or 'where'.
    .
    - Code has to be indented \"properly\", so brace and semicolon style with
    strange dedents will probably confuse it.
