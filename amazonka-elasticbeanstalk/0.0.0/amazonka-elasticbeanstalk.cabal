description:
    AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and
    scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP,
    Node.js, Python, Ruby, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache
    HTTP Server, Apache Tomcat, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS 7.5/8. You can
    simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the
    deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to
    application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full
    control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access
    the underlying resources at any time. There is no additional charge for
    Elastic Beanstalk - you pay only for the AWS resources needed to store
    and run your applications.
    .
    /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    .
    /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under
    heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!
