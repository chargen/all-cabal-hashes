description:
    AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web
    applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python,
    Ruby, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache HTTP Server, Apache
    Tomcat, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS 7.5/8. You can simply upload your code and
    Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity
    provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring.
    At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering
    your application and can access the underlying resources at any time. There
    is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk - you pay only for the AWS
    resources needed to store and run your applications.

    .
    /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    .
    /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under
    heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!
