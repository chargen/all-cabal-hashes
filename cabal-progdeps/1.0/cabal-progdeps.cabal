name:          cabal-progdeps
version:       1.0
synopsis:      Show dependencies of program being built in current directory

description:

  This utility can be used to display the version dependency
  information for the program being built in the current directory.
  Essentially it parses the dist/setup-config and displays the
  information in a readable format.  This can be very helpful when
  adding version constraints to your package's dependencies in that it
  shows what your package is currently built (or configured to be
  built) with.
  .
  n.b. It's called "progdeps" instead of "pkgdeps" because it's
  examining the build information in the current directory and not
  actual packages.
  .
  Usage: cabal-progdeps
  .
  Works with cabal-dev and cabal.
