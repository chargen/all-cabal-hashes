Name:               system-posix-redirect
Version:            1.0
Synopsis:           A toy module that allows you to temporarily redirect
                    a program's stdout.
Description:        Due to the design of POSIX, it is possible to
                    temporarily overload the file descriptors
                    corresponding to stdout and stderr to point to an
                    arbitrary pipe.  It is, however, tricky to get
                    right.  This module gets it right, as far as such
                    a terrible hack can be made right.  It can be used
                    to make misbehaving third-party C libraries stop
                    spewing to standard output. Warning: the module
                    author has concluded that due to lack of
                    portability, this module should not be used in any
                    serious sytem.  But, for those who like living
                    dangerously...
