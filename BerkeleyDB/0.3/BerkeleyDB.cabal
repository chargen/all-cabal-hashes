description:
	Provides Haskell bindings for Berkeley DB v1.x, a simple file-backed
	database library which is included by default with many UNIX
	distributions.  This package presently makes no effort to support
        modern versions of Berkeley DB.
        .
        Databases may be organized in one of four methods: in a hashtable,
        in a b-tree, in a stream of fixed-length records, and in a stream
        of variable-length records.  Custom comparison and hash functions
        are supported.  Most of the standard database API is supported.
	.
	This implementation *seems* stable, inasmuch as I don't know of any
	glaring flaws, but I haven't done anything that could even jokingly
	be referred to as coverage testing.
