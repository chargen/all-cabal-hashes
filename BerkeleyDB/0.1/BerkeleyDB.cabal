synopsis:	Bindings for Berkeley DB v1.x
description:
	Provides Haskell bindings for Berkeley DB v1.x, a simple file-backed
	database library which is included by default with many UNIX
	distributions.  Databases may be organized in one of four methods:
	in a hashtable, in a b-tree, in a stream of fixed-length records,
	and in a stream of variable-length records.  Custom comparison
	and hash functions are supported.  Most of the standard database
	API is supported.
	.
	This implementation *seems* stable, inasmuch as I don't know of any
	glaring flaws, but I haven't done anything that could even jokingly
	be referred to as coverage testing.
