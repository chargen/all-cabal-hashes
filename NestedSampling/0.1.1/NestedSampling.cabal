Name:                NestedSampling
Version:             0.1.1
Synopsis:            A port of John Skilling's nested sampling C code to Haskell.

Description:         Nested Sampling is a numerical algorithm for approximate Bayesian
                     inference. It generates samples from the posterior
                     distribution but its main purpose is to estimate the
                     evidence P(M|D) of the model conditioned on the observed
                     data. More information on Nested Sampling is available
                     at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_sampling_algorithm.

                     The original code can be found at
                     http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/bayesys/sivia/
                     along with documentation at
                     http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/bayesys/.
                     An example program called lighthouse.hs is included.

                     So far, only the simple demonstration file called mininest.c
                     has been ported. There is a more sophisticated C library
                     available at
                     http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/bayesys/nest/nest.tar.gz
                     but it has not been ported to Haskell yet.
