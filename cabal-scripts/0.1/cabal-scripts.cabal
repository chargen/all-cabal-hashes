Synopsis:            Shell scripts for support of Cabal maintenance
Description:
  This is a collection of Bash shell scripts
  for support of Cabal package development.
  The scripts are installed in your @cabal/share@ directory,
  thus you may extend your command search path accordingly.
  .
  If you are in the directory of @mypkg@
  (the directory that contains @mypkg.cabal@),
  then you may run scripts in the following way:
  .
  * @cabal-test dist/mypkg-0.1.tar.gz@:
    Unpack the tarball in the @/tmp@ directory
    and try to build it using Cabal.
    This check helps to find missing files in the Cabal package description.
  .
  * @cabal-darcs-bump-version 0.2@:
    Replaces the package and the repository version number
    in your Cabal file by 0.2
    and records an according Darcs patch.
  .
  * @cabal-darcs-upload 0.2@:
    This command supports the following workflow:
    Say, on Hackage there is version 0.0.1 of your package
    and the cabal file in the darcs repository says @Version: 0.1@.
    Now you decide to finish that version
    and to work next on the version 0.2.
    This is the time when you call @cabal-darcs-upload 0.2@.
    The call runs @cabal-test@ and @cabal check@ before uploading.
    Then it tags the repository with the current package version number.
    Then it uploads the package to Hackage.
    Finally it bumps the version of the package to @0.2@.
    This workflow makes sure,
    that you never have two different contents for the same version
    in Hackage and in your darcs repository.
  .
  * @cabal-darcs-repository@:
    Shows some lines of @Source-Repository@ fields,
    that you may copy into @mypkg.cabal@.
    We fetch the repository URL from Darcs files.
    Unfortunately, as developer
    you will certainly use a private read-write access
    to your repository like @code.haskell.org:\/home\/user\/mypkg\/@,
    whereas the Cabal field may contain a public read-only access,
    such as @http:\/\/code.haskell.org\/~user\/mypkg\/@.
  .
  See also package @cabal-sort@ that provides
  the commands @cabal-sort@ and @ghc-pkg-dep@.
