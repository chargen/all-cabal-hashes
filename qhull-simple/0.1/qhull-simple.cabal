Description:         Simple bindings to Qhull, a C library (<http://qhull.org>) for computing convex hulls. Currently, only convex hull computation in the @Qt@ and/or @Qx@ modes is supported.          
                     .
                     The Qhull library itself is not included, as I consider it a dependency. Cabal's @--extra-include-dirs@ and @--extra-lib-dirs@ can be used if the Qhull headers and shared objects are not in GCC's search path.
                     .
                     Hackage probably fails to build the Haddock documentation since Qhull itself is missing. The
                     documentation can be viewed at <http://nonempty.org/software/haskell-qhull-simple/>.

                     Notes:
                     .
                     * The current version has only been tested /very lightly/, and only with version 2009.1 of Qhull.
                     .
                     * The API will probably change drastically in future versions, especially to be more flexible with regards to input data formats.
                     .
                     Changes in version 0.1:

                     * Initial release.
