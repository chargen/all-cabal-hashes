Synopsis:            Inference with Discrete Bayesian Networks

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:  Algorithms for inference with Discrete Bayesian Networks.  
 It is a very preliminary version. It has only been tested on very simple
 examples where it worked. On bigger networks, imported from Hugin files, it was very very very slow.
 So, you can use this software as a toy. Much more work is needed to validate
 and optimize it.
