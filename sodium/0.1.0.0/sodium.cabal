name:                sodium
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Sodium Reactive Programming (FRP) System
description:         
  A general purpose Reactive Programming (FRP) system intended for \'industrial strength\'
  applications. It's a translation of a C++ implementation used for data acquisition, so
  the design, at least, has had some real-world testing.
  .
   * Applicative style: Event implements Functor and Behaviour implements Applicative.
  .
   * FRP logic is tied to partitions, within which consistency is guaranteed.
     This allows you to selectively relax consistency guarantees to facilitate parallelism.
  .
   * Instead of the common approach where inputs are fed into the front of a monolithic
     \'reactimate\', Sodium allows you to push inputs in from scattered places in IO.
  .
   * Integration with IO: Extensible to provide lots of scope for lifting IO into FRP
     logic.
  .
   * Push-based imperative implementation.
