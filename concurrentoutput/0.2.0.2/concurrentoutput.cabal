Synopsis:        Ungarble output from several threads 
Description:     This library provides a simple interface to output status
                 messages from more than one thread.
		 .
		 It will continue adding information (such as dots, or \"done\")
		 to the correct line and continue scrolling when a line is done.
		 .
		 For example, this screen:
		 .
		 @
		 Thread ThreadId 27: still working... done
                 Thread ThreadId 25: still working... 
                 Thread ThreadId 26: still working... 
		 _
		 @
		 .
		 will, once thread 25 has finished, look like this:
		 .
		 @
                 Thread ThreadId 25: still working... done
		 Thread ThreadId 27: still working... done
                 Thread ThreadId 26: still working... 
		 _
		 @
		 .
		 If standard output is not a terminal, it will only print
		 complete lines and not output any control characters.
		 .
		 At the moment, it can only handle lines that are shorter than
		 the terminal. If they are not, output will be garbled again.
		 .
