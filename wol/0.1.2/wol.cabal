name:                wol
version:             0.1.2
synopsis:            Send a Wake on LAN Magic Packet
description:         A program and library to a send WoL Magic Packet, to
                     remotely start a computer.
                     .
                     This program is useful if you have a computer that you
                     keep at a friend's house because he has a fast internet
                     connection. But he keeps turning the machine off, saying
                     that it warms up his room and your not using it anyway.
                     But now you need a way to turn the machine back on...
                     .
                     Usage:
                     .
                     > $ wol hostname macaddress [portnumber]
                     .
                     If the hostname is not statically known, you can try using
                     LAN broadcast (@255.255.255.255@).
