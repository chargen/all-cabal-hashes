synopsis:            Denotative, locally stateful programming DSL & platform
description:         (Up to date documentation is maintained at
                     <https://mstksg.github.com/auto>)
                     .
                     Read the README first!
                     <https://github.com/mstksg/auto/blob/master/README.md>
                     , for motivating examples, and concrete explanations of
                     things described here.
                     .
                     /auto/ is a Haskell DSL and platform providing
                     declarative, compositional, denotative semantics for
                     discrete-step, locally stateful, interactive programs,
                     games, and automations, with implicitly derived
                     serialization.  It is suited for any domain where either
                     the input or the output can be described as a stream of
                     values: a stream of input events, output views, etc.
                     .
                     /auto/ works by providing a type that encapsulates
                     "value stream transformers", or locally stateful
                     functions; by specifying your program as a (potentially
                     cyclic) graph of relationships between value streams, you
                     create a way of "declaring" a system based simply on
                     static relationships between quantities.
                     .
                     Instead of a "state monad" type solution, where all
                     functions have access to a rigid global state, /auto/
                     works by specifying relationships which each exist
                     independently and on their own, without any global state.
                     .
                     A more fuller exposition is in the `README.md`, in this
                     project directory and also online at
                     <https://github.com/mstksg/auto/blob/master/README.md>;
                     you can get started by reading the tutorial, which is
                     also in this project directory in the `tutorial`
                     directory, and also incidentally online at
                     <https://github.com/mstksg/auto/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.md>.
                     Also, check out the
                     <https://github.com/mstksg/auto-examples auto-examples>
                     repository on github for plenty of real-world and toy
                     examples to learn from; I've also done a
                     <blog.jle.im/entries/series/+all-about-auto blog series>
                     on this library, with examples and full tutorials!
                     .
                     Support available on freenode's #haskell-auto,
                     #haskell-game, and also on the github issue
                     tracker for the source repository.
