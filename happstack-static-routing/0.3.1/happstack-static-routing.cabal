Name:                happstack-static-routing
Version:             0.3.1
Synopsis: Support for static URL routing with overlap detection for Happstack.

Description: If you have a large routing table in Happstack and want
  to insert a new handler, you might run into overlap problems
  (ambiguity).  The new handler might not fire because it matches
  against a URL that is already handled earlier.  Or if you put your
  new handler first, it might steal requests from existing handlers.

  This Happstack support library allows you to detect overlap cases
  and build unambiguous routing tables where the order of the handlers
  is irrelevant.
