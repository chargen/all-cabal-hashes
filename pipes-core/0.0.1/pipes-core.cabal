Synopsis: Compositional pipelines
Description:
  This library offers an abstraction similar in scope to
  iteratees\/enumerators\/enumeratees, but with different characteristics and
  naming conventions.
  .
  Difference with traditional iteratees:
  .
  * /Simpler semantics/: There is only one data type ('Pipe'), two primitives
    ('await' and 'yield'), and only one way to compose 'Pipe's ('>+>').  In
    fact, ('>+>') is just convenient syntax for the composition operator in
    'Category'. Most pipes can be implemented just using the 'Monad' instance
    and composition.
  .
  * /Different naming conventions/: Enumeratees are called 'Pipe's, Enumerators
    are 'Producer's, and Iteratees are 'Consumer's.  'Producer's and 'Consumer's
    are just type synonyms for 'Pipe's with either the input or output end
    closed.
  .
  * /Pipes form a Category/: that means that composition is associative, and
    that there is an identity 'Pipe'.
  .
  * /"Vertical" concatenation works on every 'Pipe'/: ('>>'),
    concatenates 'Pipe's. Since everything is a 'Pipe', you can use it to
    concatenate 'Producer's, 'Consumer's, and even intermediate 'Pipe' stages.
    Vertical concatenation can be combined with composition to create elaborate
    combinators, without the need of executing pipes in \"passes\" or resuming
    partially executed pipes.
  .
  Check out "Control.Pipe" for a copious introduction (in the spirit of the
  @iterIO@ library), and "Control.Pipe.Combinators" for some basic combinators
  and 'Pipe' examples.
