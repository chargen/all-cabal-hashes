name:                async
synopsis:            Run IO operations asynchronously and wait for their results

description:
 This package provides a higher-level interface over
 threads, in which an @Async a@ is a concurrent
 thread that will eventually deliver a value of
 type @a@.  The package provides ways to create
 @Async@ computations, wait for their results, and
 cancel them.
 .
 Using @Async@ is safer than using threads in two
 ways:
 .
 * When waiting for a thread to return a result,
   if the thread dies with an exception then the
   caller must either re-throw the exception
   ('wait') or handle it ('waitCatch'); the
   exception cannot be ignored.
 .
 * The API makes it possible to build a tree of
   threads that are automatically killed when
   their parent dies (see 'withAsync').
 .
 Changes in 2.0.1.1:
 .
 * Safe Haskell support: @Control.Concurrent.Async@ is now @Trustworthy@
 .
 Changes in 2.0.1.0:
 .
 * Added a @Functor@ instance for @Async@
 .
 * Added @asyncBound@, @asyncOn@, @asyncWithUnmask@, @asyncOnWithUnmask@, @withAsyncBound@, @withAsyncOn@, @withAsyncWithUnmask@, @withAsyncOnWithUnmask@.
 .
 * Added @mapConcurrently@
 .
 * Added @Concurrently@ (with @Applicative@ and @Alternative@ instances)
