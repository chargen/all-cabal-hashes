synopsis:       A binding for the Financial Products Markup Language (v5.3)
description:
        FpML, the Financial Products Markup Language, is the business
        exchange standard for electronic dealing and processing of
        financial derivatives instruments.  It establishes a protocol
        for sharing information on, and dealing in, swaps, derivatives,
        and structured products.  It is based on XML, the standard
        meta-language for describing data shared between applications.
        All categories of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives will
        eventually be incorporated into the standard.
 
        This package is an automatically-generated binding to version 5.3 of
        the FpML standard.  The object-oriented typing discipline of the
        original XSD definition of FpML has been translated into Haskell's
        algebraic types.  Type classes for parsing from, and outputting to,
        XML documents are instantiated for all types.
