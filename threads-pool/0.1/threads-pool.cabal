-- The name of the package.
Name:                threads-pool
Version:             0.1

-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            A library to operate with pool of haskell's IO threads

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         This library allows you to create a pool of worker threads,
                     give them tasks using a queue and receive results. Or not receive,
                     if you wan't to. Tasks are monadic computations in any monad which
                     belong to special 'Task' typeclass (it basically means that one can
                     run that computation in IO monad, using some argument).
