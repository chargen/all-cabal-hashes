description:
     This library intends to unify, classify, demonstrate, and promote
     the use, abuse, and exploration of Streams and other infinite (co)data
     types. Many other languages have substantial feature overlap with Haskell,
     but Streams and friends proivde excellent demonstrations of Haskell features
     like laziness.
     .
     Rivers are not currently defined in this package, because they are still ill-defined.
     The goal of this package in the meantime is, therefore, is to focus on Streams.
     .
     Another goal of this package is to demonstrate the ecosystem of Rivers (and Streams),
     how identical (and indeed sometimes isomorphic) streams can be constucted in many
     different ways. OEIS (<http://www.oeis.org>) is used to verify the correctness
     of numeric streams, where possible.
