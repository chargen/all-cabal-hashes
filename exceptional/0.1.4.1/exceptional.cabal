name:                exceptional
version:             0.1.4.1
synopsis:            Essentially the Maybe type with error messages.
description:         
  This is a very simple type:
  .
  > data Exceptional x
  >   = Failure String
  >   | Success x
  .
  It's much like @Maybe@, except instead of @Nothing@, we have @Failure
  String@.
  .
  A comparison could also be made to @Either String@. I made this library
  because I was dissatisfied with the @Monad@ instance for @Either@. In this
  type, @fail = Failure@. It's rather simple.
  .
