Name:                array-utils
Version:             0.3
category:            Data, Data Structures
Synopsis:            Primitive functions for updating many elements in mutable arrays at once
Description:         An collection of functions for working with multiple elements in
                     mutable arrays. It is hoped some or all of these functions will be
                     included in the array package for GHC 7.2.
                     
                     New in this version: Basically all names have been changed. A lot
                     of redundant information has been removed as well.
