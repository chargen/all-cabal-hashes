Name:                NanoProlog
Version:             0.1.1
Synopsis:            Very small  interpreter for a Prolog-like language
Description:         This package was developed to demonstrate the ideas behind
                     the Prolog language. It contains a very small interpreter
                     (@Language.Prolog.Nanoprolog@) which can be run on its
                     own. It reads a file with definitions, and then prompts
                     for a goal. All possibe solutions are printed, preceded by
                     a tree showing which rules were applied in which order.
