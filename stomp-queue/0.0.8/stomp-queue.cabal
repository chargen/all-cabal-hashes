Build-Type:      Simple
Synopsis:        Stompl Client Library 
Description:
  The Stomp Protocol specifies message-oriented interoperability.
  Applications connect to a message broker to send (publish)
  or receive (subscribe) messages through queues. 
  Interoperating applications do not know 
  the location or internal structure of each other.
  They see only each other's interfaces, /i.e./ the messages
  published and subscribed through the broker.

  .
  
  The Stomp Queue library provides 
  a Stomp client, using abstractions like
  'Connection', 'Transaction', 'Queue' and 'Message'.

  .

  More information, examples and a test suite are available 
  on <http://github.com/toschoo/mom>.

  Release History:

  .

  [0.0.8] Client/Server on top of Queues.

  .

  [0.0.7] Fighting with hackagedb...

  .

  [0.0.6] Heartbeats caused a memory leak by creating 
          many Connection instances in the connection state list.
          The connections were lazily deleted, /i.e./ were
          not deleted at all.
          Connection state is now cleaned up by a strict delete.

  .

  [0.0.5] Underscore functions removed; 
          with* functions: withWriter, withPair;
          new option for connection (ClientId);
          Headers for broker-specific options can be passed to connection.

  [0.0.3] New interface writeAdHoc
