name:           shelltestrunner
version:        0.1
category:       Testing
synopsis:       A handy tool for testing command-line programs.
description:
                Run a given program through "shell" tests specifed by
                one or more test files, each of which specifies:
                command-line arguments, input, expected output,
                expected stderr output, and expected exit code.  This
                was extracted from the hledger project, and inspired
                by the tests in John Wiegley's ledger project.

                This uses test-framework's test runner.  Output order
                is currently a bit mixed up. Any command-line options
                are passed through to the test-framework runner, but
                they must not contain spaces, so use eg -tpattern not
                -t pattern. You may be able to get a big speedup by
                running tests in parallel: try -j8.

                Usage: 

                $ shelltestrunner [testrunneropts] executable testfile1 [testfile2 ...]

                Test file format:

                -opt1 -opt2 arg1 arg2
                <<<
                0 or more lines of input
                >>>
                0 or more lines of expected output
                >>>2
                0 or more lines of expected error output
                <<<expected numeric exit code>>>

                Lines whose first non-whitespace character is ; are
                ignored, mostly.  The first line is the command line,
                to be appended to the executable name.  All remaining
                fields are optional; when omitted they are assumed
                to be "", "", "", and 0 respectively.
