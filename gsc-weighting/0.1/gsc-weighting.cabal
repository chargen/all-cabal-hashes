Description:
  In their 1994 paper \"Volume Changes in Protein Evolution\",
  Gerstein, Sonnhammer and Chothia developed a weighting
  procedure for protein sequences to avoid over-represented
  sequences in the appendix \"A Method to Weight Protein
  Sequences to Correct for Unequal Representation\".  Although
  their method was developed for protein sequences, it is readily
  extended to work on any measurable set.
  .
  This package calculates GSC weights for any reasonable
  dendrogram.  If you want to recreate their algorithm, then just
  use @UPGMA@ as linkage and residue identity as distance
  function when creating the dendrogram.
