Version:             0.1.1

-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Access to the Github API, v3.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         The Github API provides programmatic access to the full
                     Github Web site, from Issues to Gists to repos down to the underlying git data
                     like references and trees. This library wraps all of that, exposing a basic but
                     Haskell-friendly set of functions and data structures.

                     /Currently this only supports read-only access/.
