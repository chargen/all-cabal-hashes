synopsis:      Provides the region monad for safely opening and working with
               scarce resources.
description:

  This package provides the region monad transformer. Scarce resources like
  files, memory pointers or USB devices for example can be opened in a
  region. When the region terminates, all opened resources will be automatically
  closed. The main advantage of regions is that the opened resources can not be
  returned from the region which ensures no I/O with closed resources is
  possible.

  .

  The primary technique used in this package is called \"Lightweight monadic
  regions\" which was invented by Oleg Kiselyov and Chung-chieh Shan.  See:

  .

  <http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/regions.html#light-weight>

  .

  This package provides two modules:

  .

  * @Control.Monad.Trans.Region.Internal@ should only be used by library authors
    wishing to allow their users to open their type of resources in a region. It
    should not be used by end-users directly!

  .

  * @Control.Monad.Trans.Region@ provides the public and safe interface to
    regions which can be used by end-users.

  .

  Also see the @regions-monadsfd@ and @regions-monadstf@ packages which provide
  instances for the classes in the respected monads packages.

  .

  For an example of how to use this library see the @usb-safe@ package.
