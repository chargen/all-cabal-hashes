-- Constraint on the version of Cabal needed to build this package.
Cabal-version:       >=1.6

-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Alternative faster String representations for Double and Float,
                     String representations for more general numeric types.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         The String representations provided by this package
                     are generally longer than show's output, which constructs
                     the shortest string that is parsed as the original
                     number by read. This requires some time-consuming checks,
                     so show is slow for floating-point numbers. By producing
                     a digit-string guaranteed to be long enough to uniquely
                     determine the number without caring whether there's a
                     shorter representation, the display functions of this
                     package can be faster, sometimes by a big margin.

                     Text.FShow.Raw provides building blocks for representations
                     of numeric types which don't belong to RealFloat but have
                     some of its functionality.

                     The bulk of the code is a minor modification of code from
                     the base package, whence the GHC License is included as
                     an extra-source-file.
