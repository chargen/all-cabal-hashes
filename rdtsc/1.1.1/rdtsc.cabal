Synopsis:           Binding for the rdtsc machine instruction
Description:	    This module provides the function 'rdtsc' for accessing
	the 'rdtsc' machine register on modern IA-32 processors.  This is
	a 64-bit counter which counts the number of processor cycles since
	the machine has been powered up.  Using this instruction, you can
	make very precise time measurements which are independent of the
	actual CPU frequency.  But note that you can get strange results
	sometimes on a superscalar processor.
	.
	Also note that the Haskell foreign function interface imposes some
	additional overheads.  On my machine, it takes about 950 cycles to
	call this function twice and to compute the difference, whereas in
	C the overhead is only about 88 cycles.
