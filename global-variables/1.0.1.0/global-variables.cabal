Name:               global-variables
Version:            1.0.1.0

Synopsis:           Namespaced, global, and top-level mutable variables without
                    unsafePerformIO.

Description:

  'Data.Global' provides a global namespace of 'IORef's, 'MVar's and
  'TVar's. This namespace may be accessed in pure code. Yet reading
  and writing to those 'IORef's, 'MVar's and 'TVar's happens still in
  their respective monads.
  .
  'Data.Global' is designed to meet the following use cases:
    .
    * Simplify the declaration of top-level mutable variables, by
      avoiding any pragmas as well as 'unsafePerformIO'.
    .
    * Avoid having to pass references explicitly throughout the
      program in order to let distant parts communicate.
    .
    * Enable a communication by convention scheme, where
      e.g. different libraries may communicate without code
      dependencies.
    .
    * Simplify the \"configuration problem\" - at least for code in the
      IO monad.
   .
   Note, that this library does not encourage sloppy software design
   by re-introducing all bad effects of global
   variables. Nevertheless, sometimes global variables are a suitable
   solution to a problem. In that case "Data.Global" simplifies and
   extends their handling significantly.
   .
   Examples are in the documentation of "Data.Global".
   .
