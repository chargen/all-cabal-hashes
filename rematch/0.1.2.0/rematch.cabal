name:                rematch
version:             0.1.2.0
synopsis:            A simple api for matchers
description:
    Rematch is a simple library of matchers, which express rules
    that can pass or fail. Matchers also report their failure with
    human readable output. Custom matchers can be build, and
    matchers can be combined using several predefined combinators
    or you can write your own.

    Matchers are often used in automated tests to provide expressive
    failure messages.

    Rematch is very similar to, and very inspired by the hamcrest
    library for Java
