description:
    AWS Support is a one-on-one, fast-response support channel that is staffed
    with experienced support personnel. The service helps customers get the most
    from the products and features provided by Amazon Web Services. There are
    four levels, or tiers, of AWS Support: Basic, Developer, Business, and
    Enterprise. The Basic tier is free of charge and offers support for account
    and billing questions and service limit increases. The other tiers offer an
    unlimited number of technical support cases with pay-by-the-month pricing and
    no long-term contracts, providing developers and businesses flexibility to
    choose the level of support that meets their needs.
