description:
    Amazon Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost storage service
    for data archiving and online backup. Customers can reliably store large or
    small amounts of data for as little as $0.01 per gigabyte per month, a
    significant savings compared to on-premises solutions. To keep costs low,
    Amazon Glacier is optimized for infrequently accessed data where a retrieval
    time of several hours is suitable.

    .
    /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html AWS API Reference>
    .
    /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under
    heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!
