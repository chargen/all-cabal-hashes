cabal-version: >= 1.4
name: bindings-gts
homepage: http://gts.sourceforge.net/
synopsis:
  Low level bindings supporting GTS, the GNU Triangulated Surface Library
description:
  This package contains bindings to GTS library using bindings-DSL
  macros and style. Like GObject, it's not useful by itself, but as a
  foundation for other libraries making use of its type system.
  .
  NOTE: these bindings were not made by the author(s) of GTS so please
  don't bug them about issues with the bindings! Any errors in these
  bindings are my responsibility not that of the GTS team. 
  .
  NOTE: Not all functionality is covered by these bindings at this
  time, but there should be enough to be useful.  
  .
  NOTE: Documentation does not build on Hackage DB (due to Hackage
  build hosts not having GTS on them) but can be built with 
  /cabal haddock/
  .
  Changelog: 
  .
     * 0.0.1 Initial version. 
  . 
     * 0.0.2 Improved documentation; added some missing functions; fixed a function name; bumped version of base to >=4
  .
