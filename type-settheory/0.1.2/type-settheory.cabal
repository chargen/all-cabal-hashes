name:                type-settheory
version:             0.1.2
synopsis:            
 Type-level sets and functions expressed as types
description:         
 Type classes can express sets and functions on the type level, but they are not first-class citizens. Here we take the approach of expressing type-level sets and functions as /types/. The instance system is replaced by value-level proofs which can be directly manipulated. In this way the Haskell type level can support a quite expressive constructive set theory; for example, we have:
 .
 * Subsets and extensional set equality
 .
 * Unions (binary or of sets of sets), intersections, cartesian products, powersets, and a kind of dependent sum and product 
 .
 * Functions and their composition, images, preimages, injectivity
 .
 The meaning of the proposition-types here is /not/ purely by convention; it is actually grounded in GHC \"reality\": A proof of @A :=: B@ gives us a safe coercion operator @A -> B@ (while the logic is inconsistent /at compile-time/ due to the fact that Haskell has general recursion, we still have that proofs of falsities are 'undefined' or non-terminating programs, so for example if 'Refl' is successfully pattern-matched, the proof must have been correct).
