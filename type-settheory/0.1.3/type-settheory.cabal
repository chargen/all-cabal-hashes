version:             0.1.3
synopsis:            
 Sets and functions-as-relations in the type system
description:         
 Type classes can express sets and functions on the type level, but they are not first-class. This package expresses type-level sets and functions as /types/ instead. 
 . 
 Instances are replaced by value-level proofs which can be directly manipulated; this makes quite a bit of (constructive) set theory expressible; for example, we have:
 .
 * Subsets and extensional set equality
 .
 * Unions (binary or of sets of sets), intersections, cartesian products, powersets, and a sort of dependent sum and product
 .
 * Functions and their composition, images, preimages, injectivity
 .
 The proposition-types (derived from the ':=:' equality type) aren't meaningful purely by convention; they relate to the rest of Haskell as follows: A proof of @A :=: B@ gives us a safe coercion operator @A -> B@ (while the logic is inevitably inconsistent /at compile-time/ since 'undefined' proves anything, I think that we still have the property that if the 'Refl' value is successfully pattern-matched, then the two parameters in its type are actually equal).
