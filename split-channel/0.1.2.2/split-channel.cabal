name:                split-channel
version:             0.1.2.2
synopsis:
    Control.Concurrent.Chan split into sending and receiving halves.
description:
    This module splits Control.Concurrent.Chan into sending and receiving
    halves, which allows the type system to more finely constrain program
    behavior.   As a secondary benefit,  messages written to channels with
    no receive ports associated with them can be reliably garbage collected.
    .
    In addition, this module incorporates several of clean-ups and additions
    to the venerable Chan.  Most notably,  the deprecated thread-safe
    functions have been removed,  the ability to @duplicate@ Receive Ports
    has been added,  the @sendMany@ operation allows for multiple messages
    to be sent atomically,  and the @split@ operation turns a single
    channel into two.
