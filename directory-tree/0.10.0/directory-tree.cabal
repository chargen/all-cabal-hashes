synopsis:        A simple directory-like tree datatype, with useful IO functions 
description:     A simple directory-like tree datatype, with useful IO functions and Foldable and Traversable instance  
 .
 Provides a simple data structure mirroring a directory tree on the 
 filesystem, as well as useful functions for reading and writing 
 file and directory structures in the IO monad.
 .
 Importing the library and optional (useful) Foldable and Traverable libraries:
 .
 > import System.Directory.Tree
 > import qualified Data.Foldable as F
 > import qualified Data.Traversable as T
 .
 Write a hand-made directory tree of textfiles (strings) to the disk. 
 Simulates creating a new user Tux's home directory on a unix machine:
 .
 > writeDirectory$ "/home" :/ Dir "Tux" [File "README" "Welcome!"]
 .
 "read" a directory by opening all the files at a filepath with readFile,
 returning an 'AnchoredDirTree String' (d2). Then check for any IO failures:
 .
 > do (base :/ d2) <- readDirectory "../parent_dir/dir2/"
 >    let failed = anyFailed d2
 >    if failed then ...
 .
 Use Foldable instance function to concat a directory 'dir' of text files into a
 single file under the same directory:
 .
 > do (b :/ dt) <- readDirectory dir
 >    let f = F.concat dt
 >    return$ b :/ File "ALL_TEXT" f
 .
 Open all the files in the current directory as lazy bytestrings, ignoring 
 the base path in Anchored wrapper:
 .
 > import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as B
 > do (_ :/ dTree) <- readDirectoryWith B.readFile "./"     
 .
 This version also offers an experimental function `readDirectoryWithL` that does
 lazy directory IO, allowing you to treat the returned `DirTree` as if it were a
 normal lazily-generated data structure.
 .
 For example, the following does only the amount of IO necessary to list the file
 names of the children of the root directory, similar to "ls /":
 .
 > do d <- readDirectoryWithL readFile "/"
 >    mapM_ (putStrLn . name) $ contents $ free d
 . 
 Any ideas or suggestions for improvements are most welcome :-)
