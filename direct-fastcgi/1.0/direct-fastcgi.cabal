synopsis: Native implementation of the FastCGI protocol.
description:
  This package is a native implementation of the FastCGI protocol, allowing
  Haskell to work with any webserver that supports it.  It makes no attempt to
  imitate the interface of the cgi-3000 and fastcgi-3000 packages, because
  that API is tied too heavily to legacy interfaces, as with its handling of
  exceptions, logging, and time.  Its advantage over those packages is
  primarily in the area of clean exception management and better control
  structure which allows more versatility in processing requests which are
  not simple GETs.  In particular, POST of large files should be possible, as
  should server-push responses which return content a piece at a time.  Also,
  of course, as a native implementation, there is no dependency on a C
  library, which simplifies the install process.
