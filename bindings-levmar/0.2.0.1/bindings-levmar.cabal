synopsis:      Low level bindings to the C levmar (Levenberg-Marquardt) library
description:   The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an iterative
               technique that finds a local minimum of a function that
               is expressed as the sum of squares of nonlinear
               functions. It has become a standard technique for
               nonlinear least-squares problems and can be thought of
               as a combination of steepest descent and the
               Gauss-Newton method. When the current solution is far
               from the correct one, the algorithm behaves like a
               steepest descent method: slow, but guaranteed to
               converge. When the current solution is close to the
               correct solution, it becomes a Gauss-Newton method.
               .
               Both unconstrained and constrained (under linear
               equations and box constraints) Levenberg-Marquardt
               variants are included.  All functions have Double and
               Float variants.
               .
               See: <http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/>
               .
	       Note that the included C library is lightly patched to
	       make it pure. This way the functions can be used inside
	       @unsafePerformIO@.

               All files EXCEPT those in the levmar-2.4 directory fall
               under the BSD3 license. The levmar C library, which is
               bundled with this binding, falls under the GPL. If you
               build a program which is linked with this binding then
               it is also linked with levmar. This means such a
               program can only by distributed under the terms of the
               GPL.
