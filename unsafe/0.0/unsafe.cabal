Category:         Control
Synopsis:         Unified interface to unsafe functions
Description:
  SafeHaskell introduced the notion of safe and unsafe modules.
  In order to make as many as possible modules \"safe\",
  the well-known unsafe functions were moved to distinguished modules.
  This makes it hard to write packages that work
  with both old and new versions of GHC.
  This package provides a single module @System.Unsafe@
  that exports the unsafe functions from the base package.
  It provides them in a style ready for qualification,
  that is, you should import them by
  .
  > import qualified System.Unsafe as Unsafe
  .
  The package also contains a script called @rename-unsafe.sh@.
  It replaces all occurrences of the original identifiers
  with the qualified identifiers from this package.
  You still have to adapt the import commands.
  It uses the @darcs-replace-rec@ script from the @darcs-scripts@ package.
