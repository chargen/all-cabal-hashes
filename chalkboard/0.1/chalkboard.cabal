Name:                chalkboard
Version:             0.1
Synopsis:            Combinators for building and processing 2D images. 
Description:	     Chalkboard is a Haskell hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL) for image generation and processing.
		The basic structure is a chalk board, a two-dimensional canvas of values, typically colors. 
		Chalkboard provides the usual image processing functions (masking, overlaying, function mapping,
		cropping, warping, rotating) as well as a few more unusual ones. 
		Images can be imported into Chalkboard, as first-class color chalk boards. 
		Chalkboard also provides combinators for drawing shapes on directly on boards.
		The system is based loosely on PAN, but the principal image type, a Board, is abstract.
