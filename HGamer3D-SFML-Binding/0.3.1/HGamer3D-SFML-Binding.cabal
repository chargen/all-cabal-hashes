Name:                HGamer3D-SFML-Binding
Version:             0.3.1
Synopsis:            SFML Binding for HGamer3D
Description:         
   HGamer3D is a game engine for developing 3D games in the programming 
   language Haskell. This package provides the SFML binding. 
   HGamer3D-SFML-Binding is available on Windows and Linux. 
   This binding does not claim to have full coverage of SFML 
   functionality, but only to support what is needed for the
   HGamer3D-Audio and HGamer3D-InputSystem packages.
