Name:                HGamer3D-SFML-Binding
Version:             0.1.9
Synopsis:            Windows Game Engine for the Haskell Programmer - SFML Bindings
Description:         
   HGamer3D is a game engine for developing 3D games in the programming 
   language Haskell. The game engine uses available libraries for 3D graphics, 
   sound, input device handling, gui programming and other areas and make
   those functions available for the Haskell programmer by providing  
   a Haskell API on top of that. HGamer3D is available on Windows only.
