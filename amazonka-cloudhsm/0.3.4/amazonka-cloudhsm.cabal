    The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual and regulatory
    compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated Hardware
    Security Module (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. With CloudHSM, you
    control the encryption keys and cryptographic operations performed by the HSM.
