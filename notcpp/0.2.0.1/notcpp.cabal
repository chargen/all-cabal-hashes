Name:     notcpp
Version:  0.2.0.1
Category: Template Haskell
Synopsis: Avoiding the C preprocessor via cunning use of Template Haskell

Description:
    notcpp is a library that attempts to provide an alternative to
    using CPP as a mechanism for conditional compilation. It provides
    facilities for determining if specific names or class instances
    exist and responding accordingly.
    .
    When a value or class instance appears between minor releases of a
    third-party package, a common way of dealing with the problem is to
    use CPP to conditionally use one block of code or another. The
    trouble with CPP is it's hard to statically analyse: tools based on
    haskell-src-exts will outright refuse to parse it, for example. It
    turns out Template Haskell will do the same job in some cases.
    .
    notcpp is largely a proof-of-concept, experimental package: you
    are welcome to use it if it suits you, but it may be liable to
    change suddenly.
