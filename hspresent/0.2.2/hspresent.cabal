Synopsis:      A terminal presentation tool
Description:
  Hspresent is a simple program that lets you give powerpoint-like presentations
  in your terminal (for certain definitions of powerpoint-like). It's extremely
  basic and unintelligent. Don't expect much.
  .
  Invoke like `hspresent /path/to/your/presentation`. Left and right arrow keys
  move between slides, and hitting `q` or `Ctrl-C` quits the presentation.
  .
  The file format is really simple right now. Slides are separated by lines
  consisting of the characters `--`. You can put the single character `.` on a
  line to demarcate a split frame. A split frame really creates a new frame with
  the contents of the previous frame copied at the front (this is similar to how
  beamer works).
