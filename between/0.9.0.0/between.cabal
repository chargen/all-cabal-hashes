name:                   between
version:                0.9.0.0
synopsis:               Function combinator "between" and derived combinators
description:
  It turns out that this combinator
  .
  > f ~@~ g = (f .) . (. g)
  .
  is a powerful thing. It was abstracted from following (commonly used)
  pattern @f . h . g@ where @f@ and @g@ are fixed.
  .
  This library not only defines @~\@~@ combinator, but also a some derived
  combinators that can help us to easily define a lot of things including
  lenses. See <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens package> for
  detais on what lenses are.
