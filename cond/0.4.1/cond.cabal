Name: cond
Version: 0.4.1
Synopsis: Basic conditional and boolean operators with monadic variants.
Category: Control, Logic, Monad
License: BSD3
License-File: LICENSE
Author: Adam Curtis
Maintainer: acurtis@spsu.edu
Homepage: https://github.com/kallisti-dev/cond
Cabal-Version: >= 1.6
Build-Type: Simple
Description:
  This library provides:
  .
  * Implementations of various overloaded conditional operations
  .
  * Lifted monadic variants of those operations and common boolean operators
  .
  * A typeclass for boolean algebras.
  .
  Feel free to send ideas and suggestions for new conditional operators to the
  maintainer.
  .
  Monadic looping constructs are not included as part of this package, since the
  monad-loops package has a fairly complete collection of them already.
