Synopsis:       A super small web framework for those who don't like big and fancy codebases
Description:
    Ketchup is a very small HTTP server implementation, currently under 300 LoC total!
    .
    Ketchup is also made to be as modular and embeddable as possible, if you want a cabal-free Haskell app, just take those two/three files you need and put it in your project!
    .
    Currently Ketchup comes with:
    .
    * Basic httpd functionality (IPV4 only for now)
    .
    * Regexp routing with parameters (ie. \`/user/:name/(.\*)\`)
    .
    * Static file handler (ie. \`static \".\"\` as route/handler)
    .
    Most of the project is dependency-free and only uses stuff included in Prelude, with the exception of Ketchup.Static who uses the mime-types package from Hackage, which is a single separately downloadable file.
