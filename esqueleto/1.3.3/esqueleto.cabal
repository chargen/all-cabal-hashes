description:
  @persistent@ is a library for type-safe data serialization.  It
  has many kinds of backends, such as SQL backends
  (@persistent-mysql@, @persistent-postgresql@,
  @persistent-sqlite@) and NoSQL backends (@persistent-mongoDB@).
  .
  While @persistent@ is a nice library for storing and retrieving
  records, currently it has a poor interface for SQL backends
  compared to SQL itself.  For example, it's extremely hard to do
  a type-safe @JOIN@ on a many-to-one relation, and simply
  impossible to do any other kinds of @JOIN@s (including for the
  very common many-to-many relations).  Users have the option of
  writing raw SQL, but that's error prone and not type-checked.
  .
  @esqueleto@ is a bare bones, type-safe EDSL for SQL queries
  that works with unmodified @persistent@ SQL backends.  Its
  language closely resembles SQL, so (a) you don't have to learn
  new concepts, just new syntax, and (b) it's fairly easy to
  predict the generated SQL and optimize it for your backend.
  Most kinds of errors committed when writing SQL are caught as
  compile-time errors---although it is possible to write
  type-checked @esqueleto@ queries that fail at runtime.
  .
  Currently, @SELECT@s, @UPDATE@s, @INSERT@s and @DELETE@s are supported.
  Not all SQL features are available, but most of them can be easily added
  (especially functions), so please open an issue or send a pull request if
  you need anything that is not covered by @esqueleto@ on
  <https://github.com/meteficha/esqueleto/>.
  .
  The name of this library means \"skeleton\" in Portuguese and
  contains all three SQL letters in the correct order =).  It was
  inspired by Scala's Squeryl but created from scratch.
