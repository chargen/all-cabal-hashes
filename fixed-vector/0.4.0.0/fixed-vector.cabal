Name:           fixed-vector
Version:        0.4.0.0
Synopsis:       Generic vectors with statically known size.
Description:
  Generic library for vectors with statically known
  size. Implementation is based on
  <http://unlines.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/generics-for-small-fixed-size-vectors/>
  Same functions could be used to work with both ADT based vector like
  .
  > data Vec3 a = a a a
  .
  Tuples are vectors too:
  .
  >>> sum (1,2,3)
  6
  .
  Vectors which are represented internally by arrays are provided by
  library. Both boxed and unboxed arrays are supported.
  .
  Library is structured as follows:
  .
  [@Data.Vector.Fixed@]
  Generic API. It's suitable for both ADT-based vector like @Complex@
  and array-based ones.
  .
  [@Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont@]
  Continuation based vectors. Internally all functions use them.
  .
  [@Data.Vector.Fixed.Mutable@]
  Type classes for array-based implementation and API for working with
  mutable state.
  .
  [@Data.Vector.Fixed.Unboxed@]
  Unboxed vectors.
  .
  [@Data.Vector.Fixed.Boxed@]
  Boxed vector which can hold elements of any type.
  .
  [@Data.Vector.Fixed.Storable@]
  Unboxed vectors of @Storable@  types.
  .
  [@Data.Vector.Fixed.Primitive@]
  Unboxed vectors based on pritimive package.
  .
  [@Data.Vector.Fixed.Monomorphic@]
  Wrappers for monomorphic vectors
  .
  Changes in 0.4.0.0
  .
  * Wrapper for monomorphics vectors is added.
  .
  * @VecList@ is reimplemented as GADT and constructors are exported.
  .
  * Constructor of ContVecT is exported
  .
  * Empty @ContVecT@ is implemented as @empty@.
  .
  * @Typeable@, @Foldable@ and @Traversable@ instances are added where
    appropriate
  .
  Changes in 0.3.0.0
  .
  * Wrappers for monomorphic types added.
  .
  Changes in 0.3.0.0
  .
  * @Vector@ type class definition is moved to the @D.V.F.Cont@ module.
  .
  * Indexing function restored.
  .
  * @unfoldr@ added.
  .
  Changes in 0.2.0.0
  .
  * Continuation-based vector added.
  .
  * Right fold added.
  .
  * @tailWith@, @convertContinuation@, and @!@ from
    @Data.Vector.Fixed@ removed.
  .
  * @Vector@ instance for tuples added.
  .
  Changes in 0.1.2
  .
  * @imap@, @imapM@, @ifoldl@, @ifoldM@, @zipWithM@, @izipWithM@
    functions are added.
  .
  * @VectorN@ type class added.
  .
  Changes in 0.1.1
  .
  * @foldM@ and @tailWith@ added. Type synonyms for numbers up to 6 are
    added. @Fun@ is reexported from @Data.Vector.Fixed@.
