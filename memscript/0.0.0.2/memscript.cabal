Description: "memscript <filename>"

  Run memscript with a UTF-8 (or ASCII since ASCII is a subset of UTF8) 
  plain text file.  Try to exactly guess the text line by line.  If
  your guess is wrong it will show you a diff like output comparing
  your guess and the original verse.  This will repeat until you get
  all the verses right.
  
  For the test data I included four beloved Psalms (1,23,121,127)
  from the Old Testament, each in Revised Korean Version (RKV) and
  New International Version (NIV), which I happened to have had to
  memorize.  You can use it for any other text you'd want to memorize,
  such as your favorite poems, quotes, or whatsoever.
  
  No craft or ticks, really simple and straightforward utility but
  serves well for the purpose.  I used readline because that was
  the only sane way I know of handling multibyte inputs.
