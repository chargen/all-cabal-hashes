Description: "memscript <filename>"

  Run memscript with a UTF-8 (or ASCII since ASCII is a subset of UTF8) plain
  text file.  Try to exactly guess the text line by line.  If your guess is
  wrong it will show you a diff like output comparing your guess and the
  original verse.  This will repeat until you get all the verses right.

  I included four belvoed Plsams (1,23,121,127) from the Old Testament,
  each in Revised Korean Version (RKV) and New International Version (NIV),
  which I happend to have had to memorize.  You can use it for any other
  text you'd want to memorize, such as your favorite poems, quotes, or
  whatsoever.

  No craft or ticks, really simple and straightforward untility but serves
  well for the purpose.  I used readline because that was the only sane way
  I know of handling multibyte inputs.
