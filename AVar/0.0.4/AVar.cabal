Name:                   AVar
Version:                0.0.4
Category:               Concurrency
Synopsis:               Mutable variables with Exception handling and concurrency support.
Description:            AVars emulate mutable variables, by providing a queue based
                        interface to interacting with the variable. Each variable runs
                        a 'handler' function, which reads requests from a queue and
                        processes them one by one. They can be used in concurrent
                        systems safely, and should handle exceptions thrown by
                        modifying functions gracefully.
                        
                        There is also an unsafe interface through Data.AVar.Unsafe,
                        which will throw any errors encountered while modifying
                        the variable.
