Synopsis:        Stomp Parser and Utilities
Build-Type:      Simple
Description:
  The Stomp Protocol specifies message-oriented interoperability.
  Applications connect to a message broker to send (publish)
  or receive (subscribe) messages through queues. 
  Interoperating applications do not know 
  the location or internal structure of each other.
  They see only each other's interfaces, /i.e./ the messages
  published and subscribed through the broker.
  
  Broker and application use a protocol based on the
  exchange of commands and other data packets, called /frames/.

  The Stompl library provides abstractions over Stomp frames
  and a Stomp frame parser.
  It does not implement a client or broker itself,
  but provides abstractions to libraries and programs doing so.
  It is used by the Stompl Queue library (stomp-queues).

  More documentation and a test suite can be found on 
  <https://github.com/toschoo/mom/>.
  The Stomp specification can be found at

  Release History:

  .

  [0.1.0] Major changes:

          .

          - Compliance with Stomp 1.2:

          .

          - header keys and values are now escaped;
            this, in fact, was missing for Stomp 1.1.

          .

          - header keys and values are not trimmed or padded;
            this, as well, should have been done for Stomp 1.1 already.
            Be aware that Stomp 1.0-like message headers
            may fail now, /e.g./:
            /message : hello world/
            is not the same anymore as
            /message:hello world/
         
          .

          - carriage return (ascii 13) plus line feed (ascii 10) 
            is now accepted as end-of-line;
            note that stompl never generates carriage return as end-of-line,
            the standard end-of-line remains line feed.

          .

          - the Message frame may have an /ack/ header 
            and should have when a message is sent 
            through a queue that requires explicit ack.

          .

          - the mandatory header in the Ack frame is now /id/
            instead of /message-id/. It should correspond to /ack/
            in the message that is ack'd.
            Note that, to ease backward compatibility,
            Ack frames are generated with both: 
            an /id/ and a /message-id/ header.

          .

          - a Stomp frame was added.
            The Stomp frame has exactly the same format
            as the Connect frame, but it is handled differently
            with respect to escaping: Connect header keys and values 
            are not escaped, Stomp header keys and values, however, are.

  .

  [0.0.3] Major changes:

          . 

          - new attribute "ClientId" in Connect frame 
            for compatibility with ActiveMQ; 

          .

          - all commands accept additional headers
            to ease adaptations to broker-specific features. 

  .

  [0.0.2] Minor corrections and documentation
