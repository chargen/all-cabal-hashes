Synopsis:        Stomp Parser and Utilities
Build-Type:      Simple
Description:
  The Stomp Protocol specifies message-oriented interoperability.
  Applications connect to a message broker to send (publish)
  or receive (subscribe) messages through queues. 
  Interoperating applications do not know 
  the location or internal structure of each other.
  They see only each other's interfaces, /i.e./ the messages
  published and subscribed through the broker.
  
  Broker and application use a protocol based on the
  exchange of commands and other data packets, called /frames/.

  The Stompl library provides abstractions over Stomp frames
  and a Stomp frame parser.
  It does not implement a client or broker itself,
  but provides abstractions to libraries and programs doing so.
  It is used by the Stompl Queue library (stomp-queues).

  More documentation and a test suite can be found on 
  <https://github.com/toschoo/stompl/>.
