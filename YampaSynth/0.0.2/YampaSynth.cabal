description: 
  YampaSynth is a software synthesizer implemented in Yampa, domain specific language embedded in Haskell. It contains a little framework of sound generating and sound shaping modules (e.g. oscillator, amplifier, mixer, envelope generator, filter, etc.) and example applications:
  .
    * "yampasynth-wav" is an application which synthesizes a MIDI music and writes result into a WAVE audio file.
  .
    * "yampasynth-openal" is an application which synthesizes a MIDI music and sends audio data in real-time to a sound card. We use Haskell binding of OpenAL library as an interface to audio hardware.
  .
    * "yampasynth-gtk" is an application with the simple graphical user interface which allows you to play a music with various instruments in real-time using the keyboard of your computer. We use Haskell binding of GTK library for GUI programming and Haskell binding of OpenAL library as an interface to audio hardware.
  .
  Software synthesizer uses the MIDI standard as a music description and the SoundFont standard as an instrument description.
  .
  Implementation is based on the paper "Switched-on Yampa: Declarative Programming of Modular Synthesizers", by George Giorgidze and Henrik Nilsson (<http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~ggg/publications/padl2008.pdf>), In Proceedings of 10th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages, San Francisco, CA, USA, January 7-8, 2008.
  .
  This is mainly a proof of concept, but already useful to some extent.
