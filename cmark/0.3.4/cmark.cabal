name:                cmark
version:             0.3.4
synopsis:            Fast, accurate CommonMark (Markdown) parser and renderer
description:
  This package provides Haskell bindings for
  <https://github.com/jgm/cmark libcmark>, the reference
  parser for <http://commonmark.org CommonMark>, a fully
  specified variant of Markdown. It includes sources for
  libcmark (0.20.0) and does not require prior installation of the
  C library.
  .
  cmark provides the following advantages over existing
  Markdown libraries for Haskell:
  .
  -   Speed: Conversion speed is on par with the
      <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown sundown>
      library. We were unable to measure precisely
      against
      <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown sundown>,
      which raised a malloc error when compiled into our
      benchmark suite. Relative to other implementations:
      cmark was 82 times faster than
      <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cheapskate cheapskate>,
      59 times faster than
      <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown markdown>,
      105 times faster than
      <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc pandoc>,
      and 2.8 times faster than
      <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/discount discount>.
  .
  -   Memory footprint: Memory footprint is on par with
      <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown sundown>.
      On one sample, the library uses a fourth the memory that
      <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown markdown>
      uses, and less than a tenth the memory that
      <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc pandoc>
      uses.
  .
  -   Robustness: cmark can handle whatever is thrown
      at it, without the exponential blowups in parsing
      time one can sometimes get with other libraries.
      (The input @bench\/full-sample.md@, for example,
      causes both
      <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc pandoc>
      and
      <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown markdown>
      to grind to a halt.)
  .
  -   Accuracy: cmark passes the CommonMark spec\'s
      suite of over 500 conformance tests.
  .
  -   Standardization: Since there is a spec and a
      comprehensive suite of tests, we can have a high
      degree of confidence that any two CommonMark
      implementations will behave the same. Thus, for
      example, one could use this library for server-side
      rendering and
      <http://github.com/jgm/commonmark.js commonmark.js>
      for client-side previewing.
  .
  -   Ease of installation: cmark is portable and has
      minimal dependencies.
  .
  cmark does not provide Haskell versions of the whole
  <http://github.com/jgm/cmark libcmark> API, which is
  built around mutable @cmark_node@ objects. Instead, it
  provides functions for converting CommonMark to HTML
  (and other formats), and a function for converting
  CommonMark to a @Node@ tree that can be processed
  further using Haskell.
  .
  A note on security: This library does not attempt
  to sanitize HTML output. We recommend using
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xss-sanitize xss-sanitize>
  to filter the output.
  .
  A note on stability: There is a good chance the API
  will change significantly after this early release.
