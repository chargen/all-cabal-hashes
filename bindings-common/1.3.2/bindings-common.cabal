synopsis:
  Preprocessor DSL for low level FFI.
description: 
  Packages named @bindings-*@ contain low level bindings to well
  known libraries, as a resource to be used by developers of
  higher level modules. This @bindings-common@ package provides
  @hsc2hs@ macros that allows writing code for such low level
  bindings that is easy to write, read and maintain, while
  keeping names and functionality as close as possible to the
  base library. These macros can be used as a simple alternative
  to, say, @c2hs@, or to @hsc2hs@ original macros. Bindings
  for the standard C library are also provided, and its source
  code shows how most macros are supposed to be used. More
  examples and reference documentation can be found at project
  homepage.
