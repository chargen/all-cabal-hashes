description:      
 Numerically solve convex lagrange multiplier problems with conjugate gradient descent. 
 .
 Convexity is key, otherwise the descent algorithm can return the wrong answer.
 .
 Convexity can be tested by assuring that the hessian of the lagrangian is positive
 definite over region the function is defined in. 
 .
 I have provided test that the hessian is positive definite at a point, which is something,
 but not enough to ensure that the whole function is convex.
 .
 Be that as it may, if you know what the your lagrangian is convex you can use 'solve' to 
 find the minimum.
 .
 For example, find the maximum entropy with the constraint that the probabilities add
 up to one. 
 .
 @ 
    solve 0.00001 (negate . sum . map (\x -> x * log x), [(sum, 1)]) 3
 @
 .
 Gives the answer ([0.33, 0.33, 0.33], [-0.09])
 .
 The first elements of the result pair are the arguments for the objective function at the minimum. 
 The second elements are the lagrange multipliers.
