-- A longer description of the package
Description:         simple-actors is an EDSL-style library for writing
                     more structured concurrent programs, based on the Actor 
                     Model. Computations are structured as "Behaviors" which take a
                     single input value, perform some 'Action's, and return the
                     Behavior to process the next input message it receives.
                     .
                     /CHANGES/ 0.2.1 - 0.3:
                     .
                     - added (@\<-\>@) convenience operator, and strict @send'@
                     .
                     - add composition\/transformation functions for Mailboxes
                     .
                     - drop support for older base and transformers, no more CPP
                     .
                     - depend on chan-split 0.4
