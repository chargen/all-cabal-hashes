synopsis:            Multisets with negative membership.
description:
  Multisets (or bags) are sets in which elements may occur more than once.
  The number of times an element occurs in a multiset is called its
  /multiplicity/.
  .
  This package provides an efficient implementation of so-called
  /signed multisets/ (also known as hybrid sets or shadow sets), which
  generalise multisets by allowing for /negative membership/.
  That is, elements in a signed multiset can have negative multiplicities.
  .
