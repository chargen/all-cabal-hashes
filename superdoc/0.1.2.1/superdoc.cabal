-- A longer description of the package.
description:
  This package extends Cabal's documentation building capabilities.
  It extends the Haddock markup language with syntax for subscripts,
  superscripts, bold text, non-breaking spaces, and images. Moreover,
  it works around various bugs in Haddock's and HsColour's Unicode
  support, making it possible to use UTF8 encodings in both source
  code and documentation comments. 
  .
  This package is designed to work transparently. It provides a custom
  main function that package maintainers can use in their Setup.hs
  file. In most cases, this is as simple as setting the build-type to
  Custom, adding superdoc to the package dependencies, and putting the
  following two lines into Setup.hs:
  .
  > import Distribution.Superdoc
  > main = superdocMain
  .
  For more information on the available markup, see "Distribution.Superdoc".
