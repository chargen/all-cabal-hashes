Name:                fixed-point
Version:             0.3.0.0
Synopsis:            Binary fixed-point arithmetic
Description:         This package defines a type for binary
                     fixed-precision arithmetic. The main differences
                     between this and Data.Fixed are that this is
                     binary fixed-point and it's polymorphic in the
                     underlying representation.

                     When is this more appropriate than floating
                     point? You'll mainly want to use this when you
                     need to be able to represent fractional values
                     within a bounded range. Fixed-point numbers have
                     the advantage of uniformity in these cases. On
                     the downside, you lose precision relative to
                     floating point numbers as you approach zero, and
                     you lose the ability to express very large (but
                     imprecise) values that floating point can
                     express. On some architectures, fixed-point
                     arithmetic might be faster than floating-point
                     arithmetic, but this is probably not the case on
                     x86.
