-- A longer description of the package.
description:
  An algebraic hash function, inspired by the paper "Hashing with SL2" by Tillich and Zemor.
  .
  The hash function is based on matrix multiplication in the special linear group
  of degree 2, over a Galois field of order 2^127,  with all computations modulo
  the polynomial x^127 + x^63 + 1.
  .
  This construction gives some nice properties, which traditional "bit-scambling"
  hash functions don't possess, including it being composable. It holds:
  .
  > hash (m1 <> m2) == hash m1 <> hash m2
  .
  All operations in this package are implemented in a very efficient manner using SSE instructions.
