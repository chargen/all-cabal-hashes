description:
    Traditional buffer-overflow attacks work by filling a data buffer with
    exploit code and then redirecting execution to that buffer.  As a
    countermeasure, modern operating systems will forbid (by default) the
    execution of writable memory regions.
    .
    Return-oriented programming [1] is an alternative exploitation strategy
    that works around this restriction.  The exploit payload is built by
    chaining together short code sequences (\"gadgets\") which are already
    present in the exploited program, and thus are allowed to be executed.
    .
    dewdrop is a Haskell library for finding useful gadgets in 32- and 64-bit
    x86 ELF binaries.  You can describe the desired gadget properties with a
    Haskell function, and use the @Dewdrop@ module to make a customized
    gadget-finder program.  Or you can import @Dewdrop.Analyze@ and integrate
    this functionality into a larger program.
