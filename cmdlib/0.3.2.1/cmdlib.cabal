name:        cmdlib
version:     0.3.2.1
synopsis:    a library for command line parsing & online help

description: A commandline parsing library, based on getopt. Comes with a
             powerful attribute system. Supports complex interfaces with many
             options and commands, with option & command grouping, with simple
             and convenient API. Even though quite powerful, it strives to keep
             simple things simple. The library uses "System.Console.GetOpt" as
             its backend.
             .
             In comparison to the other commandline handling libraries:
             .
             Compared to cmdargs, cmdlib has a pure attribute system and is
             based on GetOpt for help formatting & argument parsing. Cmdlib may
             also be more extendable due to typeclass design, and can use
             user-supplied types for option arguments.
             .
             Cmdargs >= 0.4 can optionally use a pure attribute system,
             although this is clearly an add-on and the API is a second-class
             citizen in relation to the impure version.
             .
             GetOpt and parseargs both require explicit flag representation, so
             they live a level below cmdlib. GetOpt is in fact used as a
             backend by cmdlib.
