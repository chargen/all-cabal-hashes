name:                data-easy
version:             0.6.1
synopsis:            Consistent set of utility functions for Maybe, Either, List and Monoids.
description:         Easy to use set of utility functions, implementing a Data.Maybe like
                     interface for other common types, like Either, List, Bool, Tuple, 
                     or even member of the Monoid type class.
                     Also features a set of conversion functions among them, 
                     using sensible defaults.
                     .
                     Most of these functions are one liners, and this library started out as a
                     self-educational project, which nevertheless proved to to be useful on its
                     own right.
                     .
