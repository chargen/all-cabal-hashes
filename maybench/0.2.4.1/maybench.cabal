Synopsis:            Automated benchmarking tool
Description:         Maybench is a tool for comparing the performance
                     between two versions of the same program, on a
                     series of benchmarks that you design.
                     .
                     Maybench aims to be easy to use, almost as easy
                     as running "time your-program arg1..arg2". Ideally,
                     it should be a simple matter for outsiders to write
                     timing tests for your programming project and contribute
                     them as part of your performance testing suite.
                     .
