Description:         PEZ is a generic zipper library. It uses lenses from the 'fclabels' package to
                     reference a "location" to move to in the zipper. The zipper is restricted to
                     types in the Typeable class, allowing the user to "move up" through complex data
                     structures such as mutually-recursive types.
                     .
                     Both the Typeable class and fclabels lenses can be derived in GHC, making it
                     easy for the programmer to use a zipper with a minimum of boilerplate.
                     .
                     First import the library, which brings in the Typeable and fclabels modules.
                     You will also want to enable a few extensions:
                     .
                     > -- Put these in a LANGUAGE pragma:
                     > -- TemplateHaskell, DeriveDataTypeable, TypeOperators 
                     > module Main where
                     >
                     > import Data.Typeable.Zipper
                     .
                     Create a datatype, deriving an instance of the Typeable class, and generate a
                     lens using functions from fclabels:
                     .
                     > data Tree a = Node { 
                     >     _leftNode :: Tree a
                     >   , _val      :: a 
                     >   , _rightNode :: Tree a }
                     >   | Nil  
                     >   deriving (Typeable,Show)
                     >
                     > $(mkLabelsNoTypes [''Tree])
                     .
                     Now we can go crazy using Tree in a Zipper:
                     .
                     > treeBCD = Node (Node Nil 'b' Nil) 'c' (Node Nil 'd' Nil)
                     > 
                     > descendLeft :: Zipper1 (Tree a) -> Zipper1 (Tree a)
                     > descendLeft z = case (viewf z) of
                     >                      Nil -> z
                     >                      _   -> descendLeft $ moveTo leftNode z
                     >
                     > insertLeftmost :: a -> Tree a -> Tree a
                     > insertLeftmost x = close . setL focus x . descendLeft . zipper
                     >
                     > treeABCD = insertLeftmost 'a' treeBCD
                     .
                     Because of the flexibility of fclabels, this zipper library can be used to
                     express moving about in reversible computations simply by defining such a lens,
                     for instance:
                     .
                     > stringRep :: (Show b, Read b) => b :-> String
                     > stringRep = lens show (const . read)
                     .
