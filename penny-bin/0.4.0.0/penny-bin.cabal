synopsis: Extensible double-entry accounting system - binary

description: Penny is a double-entry accounting system. It is inspired
  by, but incompatible with, John Wiegley's Ledger, which is available
  at <http://ledger-cli.org/>. Installing this package with cabal
  install will install the executable program and the necessary
  libraries. For more information, see the page for the Penny library,
  at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/penny-lib>.

  .

  Penny currently is designed only for UNIX-like operating systems.

  .

  You can install this binary simply by typing "cabal install
  penny-bin", which will install this binary along with all the
  necessary dependencies. However, this will not install any of the
  documentation. To get the documentation, you will want to manually
  download the "penny-bin-*.tar.gz" file, available at the bottom of the
  Hackage page (probably the bottom of the page you are looking at
  now.) Alternatively, you can figure out where the "cabal" utility
  stored the archive file for you. After unpacking the archive you
  will find a file, "penny.1", which is the manual page. You may copy
  this file to the appropriate location on your system (maybe
  \/usr\/share\/man\/man1) or you can simply view it by giving the
  appropriate path to the UNIX "man" command. You will also find the
  file "samplePennyFile", which will show you a sample ledger.
