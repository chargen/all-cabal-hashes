Name:                hyperdrive
Version:             0.1
Synopsis:            a fast, trustworthy HTTP(s) server built
Description:         hyperdrive aims to provide an HTTP server which is not only
                     extremely fast, but also provides a high-level of proof that
                     its implementation is correct.
                     .
                     hyperdrive is still in alpha and not at all suitable for
                     use. The current implementation is relatively fast, but does
                     not yet use any of the techniques for proof-of-correctness. It
                     also does not implement many essential features yet.
