description:
  .
  Wumpus-Core is a low-level library for generating static 2D 
  vector pictures, its salient feature is portability due to no 
  FFI dependencies. It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG 
  files. The generated PostScript code is plain and reasonably 
  efficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and 
  @grestore@, is minimized. 
  .
  Although Wumpus-Core only generates vector output, the generated 
  PostScript can be interpreted by GraphicsMagick or a similar 
  tool to convert EPS files into bitmap image files (e.g JPEGs).
  .
  Wumpus-Core makes pictures from /paths/ and text /labels/. Paths 
  themselves are made from points. The usual affine 
  transformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be
  applied to Pictures. Unlike PostScript there is no notion of a 
  current point, Wumpus-Core builds pictures in a coordinate-free 
  style. 
  .
  GENERAL DRAWBACKS...
  .
  For actually building pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus-Core is 
  very low-level. There are two supplementary packages 
  @Wumpus-Basic@ and @Wumpus-Drawing@ also on Hackage that aim to 
  be a higher-level basis for creating certain types of diagram, 
  but they are experimental - functionality is added and dropped 
  between releases and curently the API is too unstable to write 
  code upon (they should be considered a technology preview rather
  than re-usable libraries).
  .
  Also, some of the design decisions made for Wumpus-Core are not 
  sophisticated - e.g. how path and text attributes like colour are 
  handled, and how the bounding boxes of text labels are 
  calculated. Compared to other systems, Wumpus might be rather 
  limited, however, the design permits a fairly simple 
  implementation.
  .  
  .
  Changelog:
  . 
  v0.41.0 to v0.42.0:
  .
  * Removed the function @oboundingBox@ from @Core.BoundingBox@.
    It was unused in Wumpus-Core and had unwise error handling 
    baked-in.
  .
  * Renamed @direction@ in @Wumpus.Core.Geometry@, it is now 
    @vdirection@.
  .
  * Fixed internal Foldable instances for JoinList. The left and
    right folds worked in the wrong direction.
  .
  * Some improvements to the Haddock documentation. 
  .
