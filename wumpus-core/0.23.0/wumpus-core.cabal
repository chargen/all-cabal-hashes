  Wumpus - (W)riter (M)onad (P)ost (S)cript. 
  .
  Wumpus is a kernel library for generating 2D vector pictures, 
  its salient feature is portability due to no FFI dependencies. 
  It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG files. The 
  generated PostScript code is plain [1] and reasonably 
  efficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and 
  @grestore@, is minimized.
  .
  Pictures in Wumpus are made from /paths/ and text /labels/. 
  Paths themselves are made from points. The usual affine 
  transformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be
  applied to geometric objects. Unlike PostScript there is no 
  notion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a
  coordinate-free style. 
  .
  GENERAL DRAWBACKS...
  .
  For actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very 
  low level. There is a supplemantary package @wumpus-basic@ 
  available that helps create certain types of diagram, but even 
  this lacks the higher-level stuff (polygons, arrows etc.) that 
  would make creating general drawings easy.
  .
  Some of the design decisions made for wumpus-core are not 
  sophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are handled, 
  and how the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), so 
  Wumpus might be limited compared to other systems. However, 
  the design permits a fairly simple implementation - which is 
  a priority. Text encoding an exception - I\'m not sure how 
  reasonable the design is. The current implementation 
  appears okay for Latin 1 but may be inadequate for other 
  character sets, so I may have to revise it significantly.
  .
  WARNING...
  .
  The module @Core.BoundingBox@ is likely to be reworked 
  significantly in the future. It has too many functions that do 
  not offer distinct functionality. Some functions were removed in 
  revision 0.17.0 and some more are likely to follow. 
  .
  .
  \[1\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript 
  code, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool 
  to convert Wumpus'\s EPS files to many other formats 
  (bitmaps). 
  .
  Changelog:
  .
  0.22.0 TO 0.23.0:
  . 
  * @Basic.GraphicsState@ - extracted the font face fields from 
    @FontAttr@ datatype into a separate datatype @FontFace@.
  . 
  * Added @PtSize@ a numeric type wrapping Double. This is 
    specifically for text size calculations, vis the 
    @Core.FontSize@ module.
  .
  * Changed all functions in @Core.FontSize@ to return @PtSize@
    instead of a polymorphic type @u@ (where @u@ is an instance 
    of Fractional). To get to another unit type rather than 
    FontSize use an explicit conversion that scales the value 
    accordingly.
  .
  * Added FromPtSize class constraints to various functions in
    @Core.Picture@.
  .
  * Added @charWidth@ to @Core.FontSize@.
  .
  * Added @vlength@ to @Core.Geometry@
  .
