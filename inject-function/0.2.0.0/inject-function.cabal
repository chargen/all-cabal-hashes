-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Monadic functions with injected parameters.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         An “inject function” is a regular monadic function (like a -> m b), but adds “injected parameters”. You can imagine such a function as an action taking parameters (the regular monadic function parameters) and vertical parameters. When you compose two compatible monadic functions (the regular way is through >=>), you can choose the types of the injected parameters so that, after some compositions, you have a total control of all the process.
