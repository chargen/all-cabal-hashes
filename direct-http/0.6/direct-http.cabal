synopsis: Native webserver that acts as a library.
description:
  This package is a native implementation of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
  It lives as a library, exporting an interface reminiscent of CGI or FastCGI.
  Thus policy on how namespace is mapped to files and/or scripts is entirely up
  to the client application.
  .
  This package is partially compatible with direct-fastcgi by the same
  author, but is intended more by way of a replacement for it than a companion
  to it, and makes several design decisions differently.  The biggest is the
  use of MonadControlBase for exceptions.
  .
  [Version 0.6] Substantial reworking of MVar handling, using safer primitives
  to be much more robust in the face of exceptions in pure code.
  .
  [Version 0.5.3] Actually works with extension headers, by admitting the
  reality that they can occur anytime and not just with an entity.
  .
  [Version 0.5.2] Actually works with daemonization, by using a feature of
  direct-daemon added for this purpose to open the socket after forking but
  before dropping privileges.
  .
  [Version 0.5.1] Uses SafeSemaphore, which is the future, rather than QSem
  from base, which is deprecated.
  .
  [Version 0.5.0.1] This preliminary release is a preview to gauge community
  interest.  Not even all major features are implemented; things that exist
  only as stubs include encryption, compression, chunking, and reading back
  cookies.  Nonetheless it may be useful if run behind a reverse proxy that
  provides the missing features transparently, such as Apache.
