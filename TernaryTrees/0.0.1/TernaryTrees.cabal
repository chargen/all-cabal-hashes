Name:                   TernaryTrees
Version:                0.0.1
Category:               Datatypes
Synopsis:               Efficient pure ternary trees
Description:            Ternary trees are an efficient structure often used for storing
			strings for fast lookups. This package implements a generic tree
			for storing lists of Ord instances, and a specialised String
			implementation which is about 30% faster than the generic version.
			
			An example program is provided what shows how to use the package
			as a dictionary program for spell checking, and how it can be 
			used to serialise data with Don Stewart's Data.Binary package.
			
			From my testing, using the /usr/shart/dict/words file on my system
			(over 230,000 words), inserting all words, checking they all exist
			in the tree, writing them to a binary file, reading them back in
			and checking the read in result is the same as the original takes
			slightly over 3 seconds using the StringSet. The written file is 
			also slightly smaller than the input (by about 10% for shuffled data,
			and 7% for in order data).
			
			Future releases (coming very soon) will also have Map structures
			for key/value lookups.
