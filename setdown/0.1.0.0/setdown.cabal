-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Treating files as sets to perform rapid set manipulation.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         There will be times when you have lots of set data and you want to perform many
                     set operations quickly and reliably, you will also want to be able to add new
                     data to your set operations and be able to run the same set operations with 
                     little effort. This is the problem that setdown aims to solve. Setdown was
                     built with the intention that you would use it in conjunction with version
                     control tools to manage your set data and set description file.
