Name:                constrained-normal
Version:             1.0.1
Synopsis:            Normalised Deep Embeddings for Constrained Type-Class Instances
Description:	     The package provides normal forms for monads and related structures, similarly to the Operational package.
                     The difference is that we parameterise the normal forms on a constraint, and apply that constraint to all
                     existential types within the normal form.
                     This allows monad (and other) instances to be generated for underlying types that require constraints on
                     their return-like and bind-like operations, e.g. Set.
                     .
                     This is documented in the following paper:

                     .
                     The functionality exposed by this library is also used internally by the Set-Monad and RMonad packages.
