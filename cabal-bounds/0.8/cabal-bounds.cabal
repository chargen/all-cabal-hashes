synopsis: A command line program for managing the bounds/versions of the dependencies in a cabal file.
description:
    A command line program for managing the bounds/versions of the dependencies in a cabal file.
    .
    'cabal-bounds' is able to do these things with the bounds of the dependencies in the cabal file:
    .
    * drop them
    .
    * update them by the library versions of the current cabal build
    .
    * update them by the library versions of a haskell platform release
    .
    * update them by the library versions specified by a file
    .
    * dump the libraries/dependencies and their lower bound versions from the cabal file(s) into a file
    .
    For further details please consult the <https://github.com/dan-t/cabal-bounds README>.
    .
    /Installation/
    .
    You have to ensure, that the 'Cabal' library of 'cabal-bounds' matches the one used by the 'cabal' binary:
    .
    > $ cabal --version
    > cabal-install version 1.18.0.2
    > using version 1.18.1 of the Cabal library 
    .
    > $ cabal install --constraint="Cabal == 1.18.1" cabal-bounds
    .
    If you update the 'cabal' binary and the used 'Cabal' library changes, then you have to rebuild 'cabal-bounds'.
    .
    /Issues/
    .
    Perhaps the currently most annoying thing is, that you have to live with the reformating of your
    'cabal' file done by the pretty printer of the 'Cabal' library.
    .
    To reformat your 'cabal' file without changing any bounds you can call 'cabal-bounds' with the name of
    a section that isn't present in the 'cabal' file:
    .
    > $ cabal-bounds drop --executable=blub myproject.cabal
