description:

  Whereas most memo combinators memoize based on equality, stable-memo
  does it based on whether the exact same argument has been passed to
  the function before (that is, is the same argument in memory).

  .

  * stable-memo only evaluates keys to WHNF.

  .

  * This can be more suitable for recursive functions over graphs with
    cycles.

  .

  * stable-memo doesn't retain the keys it has seen so far, which
    allows them to be garbage collected if they will no longer be
    used. Finalizers are put in place to remove the corresponding
    entries from the memo table if this happens.

  .

  * "Data.StableMemo.Weak" provides an alternative set of combinators
    that also avoid retaining the results of the function, only
    reusing results if they have not yet been garbage collected.

  .

  * There is no type class constraint on the function's argument.

  .

  stable-memo will not work for arguments which happen to have the
  same value but are not the same heap object. This rules out many
  candidates for memoization, such as the most common example, the
  naive Fibonacci implementation whose domain is machine Ints; it can
  still be made to work for some domains, though, such as the lazy
  naturals.

  .

  > data Nat = Succ Nat | Zero
  >
  > fib :: Nat -> Integer
  > fib = memo fib'
  >   where fib' Zero                = 0
  >         fib' (Succ Zero)         = 1
  >         fib' (Succ n1@(Succ n2)) = fib n1 + fib n2

  .

  Below is an implementation of map that preserves sharing of the
  spine for cyclic lists. It should even be safe to use this on
  arbitrarily long, acyclic lists since as long as the garbage
  collector is chasing you, the size of the memo table should stay
  under control, too.

  .

  > map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
  > map f = go
  >   where go = memo map'
  >         map' []     = []
  >         map' (x:xs) = f x : go xs

  .

  This library is largely based on the implementation of memo found in
  \"Stretching the storage manager: weak pointers and stable names in
  Haskell\", from Simon Peyton Jones, Simon Marlow, and Conal Elliott
  (<http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/weak.pdf>).
