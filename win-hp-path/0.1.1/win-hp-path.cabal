synopsis:            Work with multiple Haskell Platform versions on Windows

description:

                     This package provides the @use-hppath@ program
                     for working with multiple versions of the Haskell
                     Platform on Windows.
                     .
                     Warning! The use of this program removes any
                     folders containing the string @"Haskell"@ from
                     your PATH. For Haskell Platform users on Windows,
                     any such folder is only put into the PATH by
                     Haskell Platform installations, so that behavior
                     is what you want.
                     .
                     When run in a command prompt window, @use-hppath@
                     enters a sub-shell where the PATH is modified to
                     use the Haskell Platform installed at the path
                     specified on the comand line. In other words, it
                     changes the version of the Haskell Platform in
                     the current command prompt window only. To return
                     to the original command line environment, enter
                     the command @exit@.
                     .
                     Example usage:
                     @use-hppath "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Haskell Platform\\2014.2.0.0"@
                     .
                     Please note: @use-hppath@ always ensures that the
                     hard-coded path
                     @C:\Program Files\\Haskell\\bin@
                     is located on the PATH and overrides all other
                     Haskell-related paths. This is similar to, but
                     slightly different from, the behavior of the
                     Haskell Platform itself. This can be a good place
                     to put these executables and the batch files
                     described below.
                     .
                     Batch files: This package also provides batch
                     files that allow you to select an active Haskell
                     Platform version by specifying the GHC version,
                     similar to how the corresponding shell scripts
                     work on Linux and Mac OS X. The batch file
                     @use-hp.bat@ is a wrapper for @use-hppath@.  The
                     script @find-hp.bat@ provides the mapping from
                     GHC version to Haskell Platform installation
                     folder. Currently, you must edit @find-hp.bat@ by
                     hand. Place the two batch files somewhere on the
                     PATH, such as
                     @C:\\Program Files\\Haskell\\bin@.
                     Edit @find-hp.bat@ to match the paths on your own
                     PC when you first install it, and whenever you
                     modify the set of Haskell Platform versions
                     installed on your PC.
