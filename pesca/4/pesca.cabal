name:                pesca
version:             4
synopsis:            Proof Editor for Sequent Calculus
description:         Pesca is a program that helps in the construction of proofs
                     in sequent calculus. It works both as a proof editor and as an automatic theorem
                     prover. Proofs constructed in Pesca can both be seen on the terminal and printed
                     into LaTeX files.
                     .
                     The user of Pesca can choose among different versions of classical and
                     intuitionistic proposition and predicate calculi, and extend them by systems of
                     nonlogical axioms. The implementation of Pesca is written in the
                     functional programming language Haskell.
