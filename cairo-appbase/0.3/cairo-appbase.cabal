Name:                cairo-appbase

Version:             0.3

Synopsis:            A template for building new GUI applications using GTK, Glade and Cairo.

Description:
    This template includes working callbacks to handle the File and Help
    menus and File Save/Open dialogs, with dummy handlers for selecting
    filenames and the Edit menu's Cut, Copy, and Paste. The main canvas uses
    Cairo for graphics rendering, and includes example code from the cairo
    package.
    .
    To build your own application on top of this, first grab the code. You
    can either grab it from hackage with @cabal unpack cairo-appbase@, or
    clone the git repo:
    .
    >   git clone git://github.com/kfish/cairo-appbase.git
    .
    To add widgets, install glade from your distro system and run
    @glade data/main.glade@
    .
    Note that you must run @cabal install@ to put the glade file in the correct
    place for your application to pick it up. To modify the code, edit
    @src/cairo-appbase.hs@. Hooking up functions to widgets is very simple: get
    a widget by name (which you set in glade file), and hook one of its
    signals (which you found in the Signals tab in glade) to an @IO ()@ action:
    .
    > cut1 <- get G.castToMenuItem "cut1"
    > G.onActivateLeaf cut1 $ myCut
    .
    The template code includes a trivial definition of myCut:
    .
    > myCut :: IO ()
    > myCut = putStrLn "Cut"
    .
    A real application will want to pass data to the callback. In C, this is
    fairly tedious as you only have a single void * to pass to callbacks as
    @user_data@, and applications typically do lots of marshalling and
    unmarshalling to pass data around. In Haskell however, you can make
    yourself a more complex callback handler and use a curried version of it
    in each instance:
    .
    > cut1 <- get G.castToMenuItem "cut1"
    > G.onActivateLeaf cut1 $ myComplexCut project phase 7
    >
    > ...
    >
    > myCut :: Project -> MoonPhase -> LuckyNumber -> IO ()
    > myCut project phase num = do
    >     let selection = currentSelection project
    >     when (phase == Full) howl
    >     when (num /= 7) fail
    >     doActualCut selection
    .
