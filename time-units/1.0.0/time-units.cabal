Synopsis: A basic library for defining units of time as types.

Description:
  In many cases, it is useful (either for error checking or documentation
  reasons) to define input and output types as having a particular unit of
  time. In addition, by creating a type class defining type units, this
  library should make it easier to separate the units of time the developer
  wants to think in versus the units of time the library author wants to
  think in.
