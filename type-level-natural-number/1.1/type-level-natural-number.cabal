Synopsis:            Simple, Haskell 2010-compatible type level natural numbers
Description:         This is a simple, Haskell 2010 compatible implementation
                     of type-level natural numbers.  Operations requiring
                     non-Haskell 2010 language extensions have been split
                     into a separate package.
		     .
		     The difference between this package and the many
                     others on Hackage implementing type-level
                     naturals is its emphasis on simplicity.  It only
                     supports non-negative natural numbers, and only
                     the successor and predicessor operations.  It
                     represents natural numbers using a type-level
                     linked list, so it is not intended to be used for
                     representing large numbers.  Pre-defined aliases
                     for natural numbers up to 15 are provided.
		     .
                     The code for this package was largely taken from
                     the excellent Vec package; I created this package
                     with the intent of making this functionality more
                     widely available.
		     .
                     Difference from 1.0:  Added instances for Typeable, and
                     word synonyms for N0...N15.
