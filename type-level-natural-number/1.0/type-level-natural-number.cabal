Synopsis:            Simple, Haskell 2010-compatible type level natural numbers
Description:         This is a simple, Haskell 2010 compatible implementation
                     of type-level natural numbers.  Operations requiring
                     non-Haskell 2010 language extensions have been split
                     into a separate package.

		     The difference between this package and the many
                     others on Hackage implementing type-level
                     naturals is its emphasis on simplicity.  It only
                     supports non-negative natural numbers, and only
                     the successor and predicessor operations.  It
                     represents natural numbers using a type-level
                     linked list, so it is not intended to be used for
                     representing large numbers.  Pre-defined aliases
                     for natural numbers up to 15 are provided.

                     The code for this package was largely inspired by
                     the type-level natural numbers in the excellent
                     Vec package.
