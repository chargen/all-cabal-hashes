Synopsis:            Simple type level natural numbers
Description:         This is a simple implementation of type-level natural
                     numbers that only requires DeriveDataTypeable.  Operations
                     requiring more language extensions have been split into a
                     separate package.
		     .
                     The difference between this package and the many
                     others on Hackage implementing type-level
                     naturals is its emphasis on simplicity.  It only
                     supports non-negative natural numbers, and only
                     the successor and predicessor operations.  It
                     represents natural numbers using a type-level
                     linked list, so it is not intended to be used for
                     representing large numbers.  Pre-defined aliases
                     for natural numbers up to 15 are provided.
		     .
                     The code for this package was largely taken from
                     the excellent Vec package; I created this package
                     with the intent of making this functionality more
                     widely available.
		     .
                     Difference from 1.0:  Added instances for Typeable, and
                     word synonyms for N0...N15.
		     .
                     Difference from 1.1:  Performance enhancements for
                     naturalNumberAsInt.  Simplified Show implementation.
             .
                     Difference from 1.1.1:  Gave up on Haskell 2010
                     compatibility since as of GHC 7.8 manually deriving from
                     Typeable is no longer allowed; now I use
                     DeriveDataTypeable to construct the instances.
