Name:          vintage-basic
Version:       1.0
Cabal-Version: >= 1.6
Stability:     experimental
Synopsis:      Interpreter for 1970s-era BASIC
Description:
    An interpreter for what is essentially Microsoft BASIC v2,
    what you might find on a computer in the late 70s or early
    80s, such as the Commodore 64.
    .
    Rather than making use of traditional stack-based primitives,
    the implementation uses monad transformers, including one
    with resumable exceptions that can caught by a program's
    continuation rather than its context.
