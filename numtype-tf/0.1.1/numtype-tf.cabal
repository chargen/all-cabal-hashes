Synopsis:            Type-level (low cardinality) integers, implemented
                     using type families.
Description:

    This package provides unary type level representations of the
    (positive and negative) integers and basic operations (addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, division) on these.

    Due to the unary implementation the practical size of the
    NumTypes is severely limited making them unsuitable for
    large-cardinality applications. If you will be working with
    integers beyond (-20, 20) this package probably isn't for you.

    The numtype-tf packade differs from the numtype package in that
    the NumTypes are implemented using type families rather than
    functional dependencies.

    Requires GHC 7.0 or later.
