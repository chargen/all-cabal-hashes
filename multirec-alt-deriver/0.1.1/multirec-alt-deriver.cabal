name:                multirec-alt-deriver
version:             0.1.1
synopsis:            Alternative multirec instances deriver
description:         
 New features/changes:
 .
 - Works with arbitrary monomorphic types, e.g. @([Int],String)@, not just names that refer to monomorphic types.
 .
 - The names of the \"proofs\" (= constructors of the family GADT) are now specified by the user. In other words, a proof now doesn't need to have the same name as the type whose family-membership it proves anymore. This is useful if you're working with existing code where the type's name is already taken on the value level.
 . 
 - The names of the constructor-representing empty types are also customizable now.
 .
 - The type sums in the pattern functor are now /balanced/ trees of @(:+:)@ rather than right-nested lists. This cuts down the size of the value-level code (and hopefully helps with compilation time).
