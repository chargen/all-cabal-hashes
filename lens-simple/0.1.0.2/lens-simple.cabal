name:                lens-simple
version:             0.1.0.2
synopsis:            simplified import of elementary lens-family combinators

description:         This module, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-simple/docs/Lens-Simple.html @Lens.Simple@> , just re-exports the main modules from Russell O\'Connor's 
                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family lens-family> 
                     package, the original <http://r6.ca/blog/20120623T104901Z.html van Laarhoven lens> library. 
                     @Lens.Simple@ also re-exports @makeLenses@ and 
                     other TH incantations from Dan Burton's associated 
                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-th lens-family-th>. 
                     .
                     The idea is just to make a sort of minimal-dependency @lens-family@ equivalent of @import Control.Lens@, namely @import Lens.Simple@ 
                     /-/- it's even one character shorter! 
                     .
                     As an illustration, note that the 
                     <https://github.com/michaelt/lens-family-simple/blob/master/examples/Pong.hs pong example> 
                     from the @lens@ library requires only this abbreviating change of imports. 
                     If you care to make that program more complicated, you might at some point need 
                     the unfathomably more sophisticated material in @Control.Lens@. 
                     Because @lens-family@ accords as 
                     far as possible, with @Control.Lens@, within its more limited sphere,
                     a change of imports will often be all that is necessary to begin using them.
                     .
                     It is rarely necessary to exceed the materials exported here when using
                     the lenses and quasi-lenses exported by e.g. 
                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-bytestring pipes-bytestring> 
                     or <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-group pipes-group>. It is for such
                     use-cases that this module is principally intended.
                     .
                     Note that many of the other lenses and combinators are a bit more 
                     specialized than their @Control.Lens@ equivalents: 
                     for example, _1 and _2 are here 
                     familiarly specialized to act just on real Haskell
                     pairs. With the loss of abstraction we also of course
                     lose the concomitant opaque error messages 
                     about @Field1 s t a b@ etc.
