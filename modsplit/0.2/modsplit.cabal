Synopsis:       Haskell source splitter driven by special comments.
Description:    The "modsplit" program takes a (most likely auto-generated) single-module 
                Haskell source file containing specifically formatted comments and 
                splits it into several modules according to the directives 
                contained in the special comments.
                .
                This program has its roots in HSFFIG, and the format of these
                comments is described here:
                .
                <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HSFFIG/Tutorial#Splitting_large_modules>
                .
                This program is intended to post-process the output of programs generating
                Haskell code rather than to deal with handwritten code.
                .
                Special comment values are exported by this package in order to simplify
                writing of programs that use the splitter. See the documentation for
                the "Data.SplitBounds" module.
