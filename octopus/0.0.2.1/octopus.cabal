name:                octopus
version:             0.0.2.1
synopsis:            Lisp with more dynamism, more power, more simplicity.
description:         Octopus is a highly dynamic programming language with an astounding (I think)
                     power-to-weight ratio (expressivity-to-complexity). With just a handful of
                     simple primitives, Octopus provides a complete programming environment. Its
                     main focus is on complete programmer control, not on performance or static
                     analysis. While the user can shoot themselves, the most natural methods should
                     be the most reasonable.

                     Octopus' is most useful for well-contained problems, for teaching, as a
                     (possibly embedded) scripting language, anywhere boilerplate is a serious issue,
                     for problems involving higher math, and for brain-stretching.

                     Octopus is currently in the 'useable' stage of development, in the same way
                     food might be food might be 'edible' instead of 'tasty'. We are under active
                     development, working towards 'featureful'.
